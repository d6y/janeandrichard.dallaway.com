	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last November I <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/11/dog-friendly-rest-stops-between-hull-and-brighton/">blogged</a> about the dog friendliness of a couple of places we stopped on our drive from Brighton to Hull, and back again.</p>
<p>We did the same trip again this Easter, and stopped at 2 completely different places but using a similar strategy to last time &#8211; avoiding motorway services.</p>
<p><strong>Elton</strong></p>
<p>On Good Friday we stopped north of Peterborough in the village of Elton and did a <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/02-Apr-10-15_24-EltonNassingtonLoop.kml">7.5km circular walk from Elton to Nassington and back</a>.  It was inspired by a walk named <a href="http://www.nenegallery.co.uk/blog/?p=80">Elton to Yarwell and Nassington</a> which I found when looking for <a href="http://www.nenegallery.co.uk/blog/?page_id=114">walks around Peterborough</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4486613490/" title="Flowers in the ditch by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4486613490_b7dd9dc7ef_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Flowers in the ditch" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4486623274/" title="Stepping Stones by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2721/4486623274_6538d8a7c8_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Stepping Stones" /></a></p>
<p>It was a very pleasant walk, following along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nene_Way">Nene way</a> for some of the walk.  There were no amenities where we parked, but we drove past a pub on entry to the village though I don&#8217;t know if it was dog-friendly or not.</p>
<p><strong>Saffron Walden</strong></p>
<p>On Easter Monday we headed down around Cambridgeshire and stopped at the pretty market town of Saffron Walden.  We parked at the free long-stay car park near the football ground, and managed a <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/05-Apr-10-16_32-SaffronWalden.kml">5km circular walk</a> following the walk entitled <a href="http://www.chesterford.org.uk/walks_from_saffron_walden/walk4.html">Park and Gardens Walk</a>, again found on the internet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4494796102/" title="Saffron Walden Council Offices by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2731/4494796102_c98c976b07_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Saffron Walden Council Offices" /></a></p>
<p>Another pleasant stroll, combining parkland and town streets.  The <a href="http://dms.visitsaffronwalden.gov.uk/thedms.aspx?dms=13&#038;venue=0230384">Bridge End Gardens</a> looked very nice but weren&#8217;t dog friendly so we didn&#8217;t investigate. The <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/audley-end-house-and-gardens/">Audley  End</a> Park area was very pleasant and worth a stroll.  We spotted a few pubs, cafes, tea rooms etc during our walk and would hope that at least one of them would be dog friendly, but we didn&#8217;t stop and find out.</p>
<p>So, as with last time, 2 very different places and 2 very different walks.  The Elton walk was more like our normal hikes around fields and countryside, whilst the Saffron Walden walk was much more town and street based.</p>

		<p>Thanks to <a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2010/04/guardian_interactive_chalkboards_map_and_share_soccer_games.html">Information Aesthetics</a> for pointing me at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chalkboards/">Guardian Interactive Chalkboards</a> on-line application to look at the in-depth analysis of my favourite premier league team. </p>

<p>Look, Hull City did have some shots against Burnley the other day, some were even on target.  Its just a shame that this is Premier League only, and its unlikely I&#8217;ll be able to use it to view Hull City&#8217;s stats next year 🙁 </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One year ago today we <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/03/introducing_skitters/">brought Skitters home</a> from <a href="http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/rehoming/searchcentres/shoreham/default.aspx">Shoreham</a> <a href="http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/">Dogs Trust</a>.  Over this time we&#8217;ve enjoyed getting to know our 4 legged friend, and building up a relationship with her, and both Richard and I were surprised at just how quickly she became one of the family and how attached we became.</p>
<p><a title="Skitters in Abbots Wood by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3708350458/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2636/3708350458_de3eb328e9_m.jpg" alt="Skitters in Abbots Wood" width="240" height="238" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had 2 holidays together, one in <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/02/a-week-in-filey-july-2009/">Filey, East Yorkshire</a> and one in <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/02/a-week-in-gower/">Gower, Wales</a>, both in self-catering dog friendly places.  We&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/01/sussex/">seen more of Sussex</a> than in the previous 7 years discovering places like <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/Recreation.nsf/LUwebdocsBykey/EnglandEastSussexAbbotsWood">Abbots Wood</a>, <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/Recreation.nsf/LUWebDocsByKey/EnglandEastSussexNoForestFristonForest">Friston Forest</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downs_Link">Downs Link</a>, Lancing beach at low tide etc clocking up in excess of 1000 miles of walking each (and much more than that for Skitters).</p>
<p><a title="Skitters at Seven Sisters by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3885119468/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3531/3885119468_b3f9dec522_m.jpg" alt="Skitters at Seven Sisters" width="229" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/skitters/">314 photos of her</a> to flickr, there are currently <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/doggaway/photosof/">400 photos of her</a> and she even has her own camera (thanks to the Goulbourn family who bought it as a Christmas present) which she wears on some of her walks and uploads photos from to <a href="http://skitters.dallaway.com/">her blog</a>.</p>
<p>She has generally shown herself to be a smart, affectionate dog who loves running around, playing fetch and trying to chase after rabbits.  She has a problem with people coming to the house, turning into a bit of a guard dog, and never fails to bark at the postman.  She also doesn&#8217;t really like bearded chaps (as Danny found out one day).  We have spent quite a bit of time training her, but we still have a long way to go &#8211; her recall is good in safe areas, but once she gets a sniff of rabbit, squirrel or small bird there&#8217;s no way she&#8217;s coming back.  We also have to work on her door manners and stopping her barking at every new visitor.</p>
<p><a title="Skitters at sunrise on a low tide Brighton beach by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4114326101/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2773/4114326101_edaaf9dee0.jpg" alt="Skitters at sunrise on a low tide Brighton beach" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>As a result of discovering the fun to be had on Brighton beach at a low tide, Richard wrote a twitter feed to show the <a href="http://twitter.com/brightontide">low tides</a> every day, which is published at 6.30am, just as we&#8217;re thinking of getting up to take Skitters out for her morning walk.</p>
<p>It has been a great year.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="../../../../2010/02/a-week-in-gower/index.html" rel="bookmark">A week in Gower</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Following on from my retro-blog the other week about <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/02/a-week-in-filey-july-2009/">A week in Filey</a>, I thought I&#8217;d follow up with a review of our September holiday in the Gower Peninsular.  </p>
<p>As I mentioned last time, we&#8217;d seen the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/best_of_britain/article4507084.ece">Britain&#8217;s 10 best dog-friendly beaches</a> list, and there, hogging the limelight at #1 was Rhossili Bay, Swansea which it described as</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s start with a real classic. This spectacular sandy beach offers miles of pristine sand at the tip of the Gower Peninsula in west Wales. There’s enough space for dogs to run free and there’s usually a good selection of kites to bark at. The beach even has its own shipwreck – the remains of the Helvetta, wrecked in 1887.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well that sounded pretty good, and coupled with the fact that Rhossili Bay, and nearby Oxwich Bay also made it into our <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Seaside-Discover-Britains-Beaches-Treasures/dp/1846700795">Time Out Seaside</a> book, a book which had previously resulted in us enjoying visits to Bedruthan Steps, Praa Sands, Kynance Cove and St Ives Bay in Cornwall, and Saunton Sands in Devon, it sounded like an area that we could happily explore for a week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4009377112/" title="Our holiday home by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2560/4009377112_c4d2f6018d_m.jpg" width="240" height="161" alt="Our holiday home" /></a></p>
<p>Our criteria for accommodation was similar to last time, dog-friendly (obviously), a decent kitchen (after eating in quite a lot in Filey), a bathroom with a bath (we only have a shower at our house so a bath is a lovely holiday luxury), a garden area and opportunities for walks from the front door.  After quite a lot of searching around, we settled on <a href="http://www.the-gower.com/self-catering/threeelms/threeelms.htm">Three Elms, in Middleton</a>.  This was a large house, much bigger than our home in Brighton, with a really pleasant feeling to it.  There was bookshelf after bookshelf of books, and good books too.  The sofa in the living room was long enough to lie out on and while away a few hours reading one of the books, or having a well-deserved afternoon nap.  I say well-deserved as most days found us out walking Skitters along beaches, or moors, or both.  The only thing we&#8217;d forgotten to check was the dog-friendliness of the nearby pub (a 10 minute walk away).  It wasn&#8217;t, so we ate in most evenings, or stopped off on our way back after a walk.  There was also a lack of grocery shopping for anything other than absolute essentials, resulting in us heading to Swansea to find<br />
supplies.  The grocery shop at Scurlage stocked enough for us to top up on things like bread, milk and basic vegetables, and the fish and chip shop next door, Chips Ahoy, provided us with a good helping of fish and chips.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4063086709/" title="Grass on sand by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2575/4063086709_836ea232eb_m.jpg" width="229" height="240" alt="Grass on sand" /></a></p>
<p>We visited both Rhossili beach and Oxwich bay and can testify to them being beautiful and long and clean.  But my favourite beach was actually <a href="http://www.the-gower.com/beaches/whitfordsands/whitefordsands.htm">Whiteford burrows</a>.  We approached this area through the pine plantation, walking through trees with sand surrounding their roots and trunks.  Really beautiful, tranquil and there were very few other people around.  Definitely worth an explore if you&#8217;re ever out that way.  The scenery is a bit reminiscent of Cornwall, only with all the beaches being much closer together &#8211; for instance you can walk between Oxwich Bay and Three Cliffs Bay along the beach when the tide is out, visiting two beautiful areas at once.  It is also much less crowded than Cornwall, at least in early September.  A week is long enough to visit the majority of the dog friendly beaches, and to take in some really good walks.  It is an area that I can definitely see me returning to after a few years for another week of exploration.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Tuesday evening Richard and I headed off to the Hotel du Vin for our first <a href="http://geekwinething.org.uk/">Geek Wine thing</a> in quite some time.  This one was the second of the new format Geek Wine Things, now being organised and orchestrated by Fergus De Wit and James Reina from <a href="http://www.majestic.co.uk/">Majestic Wine</a>.</p>
<p>There were 8 wines for tasting, 4 white and 4 red, made up of 4 classics and 4 bright young things.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4368639302/" title="8 glasses for tasting from by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4368639302_f64be60b03_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="8 glasses for tasting from" /></a></p>
<p>It was a great evening, and as when in the <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/02/in-hunter-valley/">Hunter Valley</a> recently, I made a series of notes.  These are made up of &#8220;wine facts&#8221; and tasting notes.  Some of the more useful are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Spanish wine system is really focussed on the aging process &#8211; so Reserva and Gran Reserva have clearly defined meanings on a bottle of Spanish wine.  This isn&#8217;t the case when these words are applied to many other nations wines</li>
<li>Good vintages for Rioja are 2001 and 2004</li>
<li>The younger a red wine, is the more breathing time it is likely to need</li>
<p><lI>When thinking about wine and food matching, a good hint is to choose the kind of food that is served where the wine is made</li>
<li>If you buy a Spanish Reserva or Gran Reserva, then you&#8217;re probably on to a winner</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4367892711/" title="Checking the colour by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2694/4367892711_3a6f013710_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Checking the colour" /></a></p>
<p>Out of the white wines, my favourite was the first we tasted.  This was <a href="http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-albarino/product-is-14266">Albariño Martin Codax 2008 Rias Baixas</a>.  Albarino wasn&#8217;t a wine that I&#8217;d knowingly tasted before, and is indigenous to that particular area of Spain.  It was described as being a good halfway house between Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4368638826/" title="Wine #5 by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4050/4368638826_dcaf72557c_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Wine #5" /></a></p>
<p>Out of the red wines, there were 2 that I really liked.  These were <a href="http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-ribiera/product-is-14437">Emilio Moro 2006 Ribera del Duero</a> and Muriel Gran Reserva 1996.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribera_del_Duero">Ribera del Duero</a> is an up and coming wine area, and the Emilio was a lovely drink.  The recommendation was to buy two bottles, drink one now and bury one in the bottom of your garden for 3 to 5 years to age further.  Apparently <a href="http://www.erobertparker.com/">Robert Parker</a> gave it a score of 92 &#8211; which marks it out as being a good buy.  The Muriel is ready for drinking now and was a lovely smooth wine.  As Richard said, if either of these were served to us we&#8217;d be delighted.</p>
<p>Apparently, Majestic are running a promotion on Spanish wines next month, so I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be heading down there to pick up some of these for our drinking pleasure.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As our blog was broken from around the time we got back from our holiday last July, I never got around to writing about it.  So here&#8217;s a few quick thoughts about it.</p>
<p>This was our first holiday with Skitters.  In recent years we&#8217;ve often spent our summer holidays in the UK, preferring to head further afield for snowboarding holidays.  This year we would do no different.  But, we did need to consider some new things.  We needed it to be dog friendly (obviously), we needed it to have a garden of some description, and ideally we needed it to be somewhere we could walk the dog.</p>
<p>As a child I spent summer holidays on the East Coast, mostly in Bridlington but often with day trips further afield to Whitby, Robin Hood&#8217;s Bay and Filey.  I remember these trips with fondness, and have always had a particular soft spot for Robin Hood&#8217;s Bay.  Richard had visited a few of these places with me and my family years ago, but neither of us had really explored under our own steam.  Filey has a very long, sandy beach which is mostly dog friendly (only the bit closest to Filey itself isn&#8217;t) and stretches from Filey down to Hunmanby.</p>
<p>We found ourselves <a href="http://www.thebayfileycottagerental.co.uk/">a lovely house</a> in <a href="http://www.thebayfiley.com/">The Bay</a> estate (on the grounds of the old Butlins camp) which was so dog friendly it even had dog bowls.  They had a no dogs upstairs restriction which was fine as they&#8217;d provided a child gate to put on the stairs &#8211; without this we might have struggled somewhat 🙂</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3849626580/" title="The Bay, Filey by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3151/3849626580_f7f547f008_m.jpg" width="240" height="161" alt="The Bay, Filey" /></a></p>
<p>The Bay estate is still being worked on, and looks to have quite a lot of space still available to it.  The pub was open, and a couple of shops but there are still quite a few opportunities for development which I believe to be underway.  The walk from the house to the beach was about 1km and this delivered us at a good dog-friendly stretch of beach (as long as the tide was out &#8211; at high tide there is no beach at all).  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3769888532/" title="Looking towards Filey by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2625/3769888532_d21c0c4f2d_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Looking towards Filey" /></a></p>
<p>Our adventures took us all around the area including a visit to Dane&#8217;s Dyke beach (listed on the Times list of <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/best_of_britain/article4507084.ece">Top 10 dog-friendly beaches</a>) , a walk into Dalby Forest (I remember a school trip there as a child), visits to Staithes, Robin Hood&#8217;s Bay, Runswick Bay and even along a bit of the <a href="http://www.coast2coast.co.uk/">Coast to Coast walk</a>.  It was a great trip and an excellent first holiday with a dog in tow. </p>

		<p>Whilst I was <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/31-Jan-10-12_11-stanmer.kml">walking along the South Downs</a> with Richard and Skitters early today, I was struck by how much I love living in Sussex, and how much more I&#8217;ve seen of it in the past year.</p>
<p>We first moved here in 2001, and at that time our priorities were being close to a train station, and being in the centre of town &#8211; both because, at that time, I was commuting into Farringdon on a daily basis.  Over the first year we made excursions out and about, especially when we had visitors.  </p>
<p>Over the next few years, we did quite a bit of mountain biking, and discovered lots of lovely trails which could be accessed either directly from the centre of town, or by getting on a train.</p>
<p>These days we load the dog and ourselves into the car (mostly) and head off in search of views.  Over the past 9 months, we&#8217;ve visited many areas of Sussex, from Camber, to Friston Forest and the Seven Sisters, to the River Adur.  This weekend has seen us walk around Devil&#8217;s Dyke and around Stanmer &#8211; both accessible by public transport.  This afternoon I lost myself in the hills, and dales, the valleys, the trees, and was happy.</p>

<p>
Just a quick pre Christmas post to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>
<p>2009 was the year that we finally got a dog, the lovely <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/tag/skitters/">Skitters</a> joined us 9 months ago from Shoreham <a href="http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/">Dogs Trust</a>.  Obviously, we think she&#8217;s the cutest dog in the country, and that everyone should own a picture of her.  </p>
<p>So, we armed her with a plush santa toy (which miraculously is still in one piece), covered the sofa in a sheet, and I practiced my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2009/11/flash-improve-your-lighting-techniques.html">off-camera flash techniques</a> learnt at my <a href="http://garage-studios.co.uk/">Garage Studios</a> <a href="http://garage-studios.co.uk/courses/flash">Flash</a> course to produce 4 photos that we were happy with.  A quick upload to the lovely people at <a href="http://uk.moo.com/en/">Moo</a> and a few days later I collected 75 lovely Christmas cards from the post office.   </p>
<p>This photo, the composite, was used as the rear image, with the front showing a full size version of one of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622745622821/">individual photos</a>.  So, if you got one of these cards, I hope you liked it, if you didn&#8217;t, well, erm, sorry about that&#8230;</p>

		<p>In years gone by I have relied upon recommendations from friends or buying compilation albums (like the <a href="http://www.mercuryprize.com/">Mercury Music prize</a> album) to get an idea of artists I might like.  Since March 2007 I have been <a href="http://www.netlingo.com/word/scrobble.php">scrobbling</a> my music to <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> which gives me some interesting statistical insights (like my 2nd most popular &#8220;artist&#8221; is BBC Radio 4 :-)) and tells me that I&#8217;ve listened to 10663 different tracks. </p>
<p>One of the features that I really like about Last.fm, is the fact that it gives me recommendations based on other artists I&#8217;ve listened to which changes over time as more tracks are listened to.  In recent months I&#8217;ve used these recommendations in conjunction with <a href="http://spotify.com/">spotify</a> to give them a listen to, and in some cases this has resulted in me buying an album.</p>
<p>Last.fm have always been good at using the vast quantity of data that they get, and this year is no different.  Over the past few weeks they&#8217;ve released the <a href="http://www.last.fm/bestof/2009">Best of 2009</a> list which is </p>
<blockquote><p>the hottest and most popular artists of the year based on your scrobbles</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken this list, and created a <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/janefoth/playlist/7cP9IjdtvdW2Dyht0NbsEt">spotify playlist</a> made up of the Top 5 tracks for each artist mentioned in it.  I&#8217;ve been listening to it over the past day or so and have found some promising artists I hadn&#8217;t stumbled upon before &#8211; <a href="http://www.last.fm/bestof/2009/chart/36">The Fray</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/bestof/2009/chart/35">Metric</a> to name just two.</p>
<p>If you need a spotify invite, then leave me a comment or drop me a line, I currently have 9 invites left. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4178834628/" title="Santa Jane and Skitters by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2799/4178834628_2099947591_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Santa Jane and Skitters" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4178832896/" title="3 Madgexian Santas: Alex, Martin, Jane by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2649/4178832896_9bb2e76836_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="3 Madgexian Santas: Alex, Martin, Jane" /></a></p>
<p>In a similar manner to last year, I hooked up with <a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/">Seb</a> and we &#8220;dashed&#8221; around the course together. I&#8217;d set the virtual trainer on my Garmin Forerunner 205 with a 35 minute aim which was, if I&#8217;m honest, somewhat ambitious. I kept an eye on our pace and it was pleasing to watch the distance between us and our virtual pace setter increase (in the right direction). At the halfway point we calculated we were on about a 33 minute pace &#8211; last year I did 33:03 &#8211; so we kept on going. The last 1k was tough going, but we kept on and looking at the splits actually increased our pace before managing a &#8220;dash&#8221; to the line finishing at, a frankly surprising, 30:22.</p>
<p>Richard used his flip video to record some footage which is <a href="http://blip.tv/file/2964531">over at blip.tv</a> (as well as below):<br />
