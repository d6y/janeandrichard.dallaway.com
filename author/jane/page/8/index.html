<p>On 6th February 1999 Hull City were at the bottom of the football league, with little to shout about &#8211; the club was going nowhere, the owner wasn&#8217;t contributing and it looked like Hull City didn&#8217;t have much of a future.  We were living in Ealing at the time, and when I spotted the Brentford v Hull match I decided that we should go and offer my team some of the support it needed.  That started my adult attendance of Hull City games and we won 2 &#8211; 0 starting what became known as the <a href="http://stats.football.co.uk/league_two/1998/">Great Escape</a> led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Joyce">Warren Joyce</a>.  Over the next few seasons we attended quite a few of the Southern games including trips to Southend, Cheltenham, Leyton Orient (including for the <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/05/leyton_orient_2_0_hull_city">play offs in 2001</a>), Barnet, Hayes (for an FA cup match), Brighton (at Gillingham) and at the Withdean,  as well as some games at Boothferry Park (vs Barnet Feb 2001) and later in the KC Stadium (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622635098545/">vs Bournemouth Easter 2003</a>).</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t managed any games this season &#8211; when we were in Hull, the Tigers weren&#8217;t, and when they were down here, we weren&#8217;t &#8211; but both Richard and I had been carefully checking the scores, and were keeping a very close eye on the end of the season.  </p>
<p>When Hull made it through the playoff semi-finals and into the final at Wembley I knew that I had to do whatever I could to go (along with every other Hull fan).  I was up checking the website at 8am last Monday morning, when the remaining 3800 tickets went on sale (to non-season ticket holders) but failed to get any &#8211; I kept selecting them and getting to an error on the website.  Aagghh!!</p>
<p>I found some (very expensive) tickets via <a href="http://www.1st4footballtickets.com/">1st4FootballTickets</a> and decided that I really wanted to be at the match &#8211; the first trip to Wembley for Hull City after 104 years, I couldn&#8217;t afford to wait another 104 for an opportunity to see my team on what might be the biggest stage in Europe.  I bought the tickets, they turned up without problem and got me access to the ground.  Hurrah!</p>
<p>On Saturday we arrived at Wembley at around midday, leaving ourselves plenty of time to soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the experience.  I have been to Wembley for a football match only once before, a rather poor 0 &#8211; 0 friendly between England and Norway in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team_results#1994">1994</a>, and so was keen to experience the &#8220;new Wembley&#8221;.  The walk down Wembley Way towards the stadium was impressive, looking towards the stadium and the arc and seeing the familiar colours of black and amber lining the street along with the red and white of Bristol City.  </p>
<p>We made our way into the ground, found <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/2521740326/">our seats</a> and then took a wander around to find a beer.  I&#8217;ve never seen a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/2521705154/in/set-72157605226187517/">Champagne and Seafood</a> bar at a football ground before, but we were in the Club Wembley section which I guess explains it.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was great, and the noise was fantastic &#8211; the sounds of the supporters singing just echoed around the ground.  We watched some of the warm up, the pre-match fireworks and presentation of the teams before the match started.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve nothing to add about the quality of the football that hasn&#8217;t been said <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7416502.stm">elsewhere</a> &#8211; <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/05/a_£60_million_moment...">Dean Windass&#8217;s wonder goal</a> &#8211; lots and lots and lots of attempts by Bristol City, but nothing really of power.  Boaz Myhill and the defence did a great job and kept another clean sheet. </p>
<p>The final whistle blew, and the Hull supporters (and team) celebrated for all we were worth (I know I had little voice left yesterday).  And so, Hull City are in the Premiership and Plymouth get the title of &#8220;Biggest town in Britain never to have seen top flight football&#8221; &#8211; Hull City still holds the title of &#8220;Only football club in Britain that has no letters you can colour in&#8221; though 🙂</p>
<p>Richard is keen to point out that we&#8217;re still on track to meet <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2005/04/we_are_going_up_i_say_we_are_going_up._oh_yeah!">his prediction of being winners of the Premiership in 2017</a>.<br clear="all" /></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://authenticblogging.com/">Libby</a> asked this question last November at the <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blog/archives/2007_11_01_index.php#8145247384104273462">Brighton Bloggers meetup</a>.  It&#8217;s taken me a while to get around to actually answering this question properly, and in fact it might be a better starting point to ask:</p>
<p><strong>Why did I start blogging?</strong><br />
<br />
Richard and I started this blog back in <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/03/">March 2001</a> and back then it was to save bookmarks centrally, to leave ourselves reminders and to keep our friends, overseas or local, up to date with what we were up to.  Since then, I&#8217;ve started 2 other blogs &#8211; <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/blog.html">Jane&#8217;s Technical Stuff</a> and <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/photoblog.html">Jane&#8217;s Photography blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why separate blogs rather than just one?</strong><br />
<br />
Originally, the technical and photographic blogs shared a home with the joint blog with Richard, but it seemed a bit weird to have no separation between <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/blog.html">work</a> and <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/blog/">home</a>.  If I documented some feature on my technical blog during the working day, then I might want colleagues to read it, without them necessarily having to search through <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/05/vegetables_growing">photos of my garden</a>.  The photography blog is the least active of the three, and is a place for <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/review.html">reviewing</a> lenses, equipment and for sharing good podcast/vodcasts I&#8217;ve come across.  </p>
<p>
<strong>Has the reason for blogging changed?</strong><br />
<br />
Sort of, I still blog technically on things I&#8217;ve found out, especially if I&#8217;ve had problems finding an answer using good old google. I still use them a little bit for bookmarking, but only when I&#8217;ve got some extended comments to make about it &#8211; otherwise I use <a href="http://del.icio.us/Ull">del.icio.us</a>.  In 2003 I did an interview with the <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/">Mirror</a> about being a blogger, reading the <a href="http://del.icio.us/Ull">extract I took</a> of it shows that actually my reasons haven&#8217;t really changed over the past 5 years.</p>

<p>The bottom right hand corner are my potatoes 9 days before this photo &#8211; the potatoes here are again the bottom right hand of the photo.

<a href="http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/comedy/listing.asp?ev=1231&#038;ed=9258">Open Wide</a> &#8211; A comedy sketch show with 2 actors covering topics from Justin Timberlake appearing on a history program, to Hitler being investigated by Columbo and the Sweeney.  Not the funniest show I&#8217;ve ever seen but had some good sketches</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.finalcut.gb.com/archive_11_05_08.html">Final Cut: Lightning Documentary Challenge</a> &#8211; showing short films (2 minutes each) produced by teams in 24 hours covering one of the fringe acts appearing on Saturday. Some great films and even better an opportunity to catch some more fringe acts &#8211; the <a href="http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/listing.asp?ev=1626&#038;ed=10350">Pet Sounds v Sgt Pepper</a> show looked good, and we even had live music from <a href="http://thetopbananas.net/">The Top Bananas</a> whilst the judging was going on.  Some of the films are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/BrightonFinalCut">now available on youtube</a></li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.totalbeast.co.uk/catchy.html">Catchy! The Great plague musical</a> &#8211; A cross between a Carry On film and a pantomime. Smutty, funny and with some great tunes to hum along to.  And a bargain at &#163;8 for a good 2 hours worth of entertainment.  I&#8217;m still not sure if the guy sitting next to me sneezing during a musical about the plague was a good sign though.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The festival continues for another 10 days or so and we&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/comedy/listing.asp?ev=1617&#038;ed=10152">couple</a> <a href="http://www.sherlock-holmes.org.uk/event_info.php?id=120">more</a> shows to attend.</p>

<p>I took this photo in the grounds of the <a href="http://www.silvermt.com/Lodging/default.aspx?page=Lodging">Morning Star Lodge</a> near the <a href="http://www.silvermt.com/">Silver Mountain</a> Gondola station in Kellogg, Idaho with the sole intention of posting it to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/stickfiguresinperil/">Stick Figures in Peril group</a>.  This I duly did and someone added a tag of Mr Ouch.  I was curious about this and so looked at <a href="http://icanhaz.com/mrouch">all photos tagged with Mr Ouch</a> and discovered that they are all the same peril picture but with different text, instructions and warnings &#8211; a sub domain of stick figures in peril.</p>
<p>I will now be on the lookout for other Mr Ouch warning signs to add to the collection.<br clear="all" /></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve gained some nice new gadgets, which I&#8217;ve reviewed over at <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/blog.html">one</a> or <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/">other</a> of my other blogs.  But, this was originally the home of gadget reviews, so here&#8217;s an overview with links to my other musings.</p>
<p><a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/6110.html">Nokia 6110 Navigator</a> &#8211; I got this phone on Vodafone in August time and its the first phone that I&#8217;ve made use of as a general device rather than just a phone.  I use the mobile internet on it quite a lot to keep up with google reader and twitter (mainly).  I make use of the GPS tracking via the <a href="http://research.nokia.com/research/projects/SportsTracker/">Nokia Research project SportsTracker</a> and have <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/user/profile.do?u=janedallaway">uploaded some tracks</a> to their new <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/main/index.do">beta community site</a> as well as listing them all in our <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/">maps</a> section.  This has taken over from the combined <a href="http://sportsdo.net/">SportsDo</a> on an old <a href="http://www.mobileburn.com/review.jsp?Id=520">Sony P900</a> connection to an <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Globalsat-BT338-x-trac-bluetooth-receiver/dp/B00092759S/richarddallaway">external bluetooth GPS</a>.  The major advantage of the 6110 Navigator is that the routes can be saved directly from the memory card, with SportsDo they had to be uploaded over mobile internet to the SportsDo site before then allowing them to be downloaded in google maps format.<br />
The 6110 Navigator also comes with Route 66 software with which I&#8217;ve <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/route66.html">had a few battles</a> but am now getting on fine with.</p>
<p><a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/ipod%20touch.html">iPod Touch</a> &#8211; I got this as a Christmas present and I love it.  I got a <a href="http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore.woa/wa/RSLID?n=ipodtouch1&#038;fnode=standard/home/shop_ipod/ipod_accessories/cases/ipodtouch1&#038;nplm=TQ404&#038;mco=47F2EE2">rubberised case</a> for it as part of my Christmas gift but also bought a <a href="http://www.powersupportusa.com/products/ipod/ip_touch_film.php">screen protector</a> for it (after I&#8217;d managed to give it a small scratch).  Since getting this I&#8217;ve started watching a lot more video podcasts, especially to do with <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/podcast.html">photography</a>.  I purchased the $20 January upgrade and am finding the mail application really great to use.</p>
<p><a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/pixelbank.html">Braun PixelBank</a> &#8211; As I wind up taking more and more photographs with my beautiful <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/d80.html">Nikon D80</a> the ability to recycle my SD cards quickly enough is getting to be more of a challenge, especially when I am without my laptop.  So, I decided it was time to buy a portable storage unit that could read from SD and xD (for my little <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/fe130.html">Olympus fe130</a>).  It has 60GB of storage all held on a 2.5 inch replaceable hard disk and can be charged via USB and uses USB 2 for transfers.</p>
<p>3 different gadgets, all so far being enjoyed&#8230;</p>
