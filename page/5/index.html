	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks ago we went to a Halloween party at the home of some dog-club friends of ours &#8211; their dog, <a href="http://twitter.com/4pawsnexus">Pebbles</a>, and our dog, <a href="http://twitter.com/doggaway">Skitters</a>, play nicely together much of the time.  Whilst we were there we discovered that <a href="http://jonnynexus.com/">one of them</a> is a published author. In fact, he kindly lent me a copy of <a href="http://www.jonnynexus.com/gamenight/">Game Night</a> which I&#8217;m part way through and enjoying a lot.</p>
<blockquote><p>Game Night tells the story of six roleplaying gods, playing a very bad roleplaying game with the mortal world below</p></blockquote>
<p>I met him this morning whilst we were walking our respective hounds, and we were chatting about his day off today (he normally commutes into London so I only see him on his days off or at weekends).  He told me he was planning to spend a lot of it publicising the release of his novel in episodic format on <a href="http://www.enworld.org/">EN World</a> and I asked him to send me the details, and I&#8217;d mention it in a blog post.  So, here it is, the <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/blogs/jonny-nexus/2059-game-night-chapter-one-gate.html">link to chapter one</a>, a chapter where</p>
<blockquote><p>The story starts as our heroes reach an ancient structure that guards an equally ancient secret. What is the Gate? Who is the Gatekeeper? Will the adventurers ever stop killing him long enough for him to finish speaking his introductory text?</p></blockquote>
<p>And if after reading the first chapter you&#8217;re hungry for more and can&#8217;t wait for 25 more weeks, then you can always buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Night-Jonny-Nexus/dp/1906402019/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1258402721&amp;sr=8-1">paperback</a>, or the <a href="http://fantasy.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=65774&amp;filters=0_0&amp;manufacturers_id=2630">PDF version</a>.  Any chance of an ePub version Jonny?</p>
<p>Update: There is now a kindle version. Read more at <a href="http://jonnynexus.com/2011/06/23/game-night-on-kindle-its-here/">Game Night on Kindle: Itâ€™s Here!</a></p>

<p>The flickr uploader crashed on me lots of times this afternoon &#8211; it was fine this morning whilst I uploaded a whole heap of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/collections/72157600203434892/">travel photos</a> but this afternoon it just stopped responding, on at least 4 occasions and on at least 2 occasions managed to eat (or delete) some photos from my hard drive.  After a quick check I updated to the latest <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploadr/">flickr uploadr</a> and started again, but I was a bit more careful this time and only uploaded one set at a time.

		<p>Another family related newspaper clipping, this one relates to the death of my Great-Great-Grandfather (I think) in 1875.  Again, preserved by a family member, and transcribed by me.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Goole and Marshland Times &#8211; 10th December 1875<br />
Shocking fatal accident at Cliffe</strong></p>
<p>A shocking accident occurred at Cliffe, on Wednesday morning to a railway porter named William Varley employed at the Hemingbrough station, whereby he lost his life by being run over by a pick-up goods train from Selby to Hull at 7.43 am. The poor fellow had been to to the distance signal towards Selby, and in returning with the lamps when near to the Hemingbrough station, he attempted to cross the line in front of the train which was drawing up slowly, but was not quick enough in taking his second step, and was consequently knocked down by the buffer-plank of the engine, the wheels of which ran over him, completely severing the head and right arms from his body. The deceased was much respected, and had been in the employment of the company between six and seven years, being the greater part of that time stationed at Selby. An inquest was held in the afternoon at the house of Mr. Pratt, before Mr. Coroner Taylor, Wakefield, and a responsible jury of which Mr. Keighley Barton was foreman. The body having been viewed by the jury, the following evidence was adduced :- Mr. Wm,. Varley, father, Wistow Lordship, swore to the body being that of his son, which he has last seen in good health at Wistow three weeks ago. Witness said deceased had been used to the railway business for the past six or seven years, and appeared to be perfectly comfortable with his family. Deceased was 27 years of age. John E. Smith, signalman at Hemingbrough station, said he saw the deceased in the morning about 7 o&#8217;clock in the porters&#8217; room. Deceased did not appear to be at all depressed in mind, but as cheerful as usual, and was perfectly sober. Witness then went to his cabin, and did not see any more of deceased until he saw him go to the distance signal lamps, &#038;c. He saw deceased attempt to cross the line in front of the &#8220;pick-up&#8221; goods train from Selby to Hull, which was due at Hemingbrough at 7.43 am, but as he was taking his second step he was caught by the buffer-plank of the engine and knocked down. Deceased, witness believed, was caught on the shoulder. He saw deceased fall, and afterwards saw his body or the wheels roll over and over. The train was going very slowly, having not quite reached its regular place, as in the ordinary course of things it would have gone 50 yards further. Deceased was coming from the north to the south side of the line near the station with four lamps in his hands and arms. It was quite light at the time. As soon as witness saw the deceased knocked down he immediately informed the station-master. By the foreman : I have never known deceased to have too much drink. By the coroner : Deceased, just before attempting to cross, took a side look at the train, but was not quite quick enough in crossing. Thomas Sweeting, an under-porter at the railway station, said he saw deceased in the morning at half-past six o&#8217;clock, he was then in his usual health. The further evidence of this witness was in corroboration of the last witness, and the jury, considering other evidence being unnecessary, returned a unanimous verdict of &#8220;Accidentally killed&#8221;. The jury very kindly gave their fees, adding something more to it to the widow of the deceased, who also leaves three children. Mr. G. Brown, solicitor, of York, watched the enquiry on behalf of the company, but no blame appeared to be attached to any person.</p></blockquote>

		<p>At some point in the past, a clipping of my Grandparents&#8217; wedding had been sent to Grandma&#8217;s cousin in the US.  A few years ago, they sent me a copy of it.  I transcribed it and so here it is.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hull Wedding<br />
Mr J.W.Duffield and Miss S. Garnett</strong></p>
<p>The wedding took place at All Saints&#8217; Church, Margaret-street, Hull, on Saturday of Mr John William Duffield, second son of the late Mr and Mrs John Duffield, of Hull, and Miss Sallie Garnett, daughter of Mr and Mrs Robert Garnett, of Northumberland-avenue, Hull. The Rev J. Jiles officiated and Mr Dove was at the organ.</p>
<p>The bride, who was given away by her father, wore a gown of filmy white georgette with fitting corsage enhanced by the addition of an artistically designed yoke of angel skin lace. Her anke-length skirt fell into rich billowy folds and was edged with a deep flounce of angel skin lace. An underlining og stiff net emphasised the fullness of the skirt and her lace coatee had well-cut sleeves with soft folds of white georgette.</p>
<p>A handsomely embroidered veil of tulle was worn, and was fashioned into a head-dress effect, held in position by a coronet of orange blossom, and falling into a train down to the hem of the skirt. The bouquet was of pink roses.</p>
<p>The chief bridesmaids were Gracie Garnett (sister of the bride), and Edith McCowan (friend), and a tiny bridesmaid, Miss P. Garnett, also attended. The elder girls wore gowns of shell pink chiffon-velvet, designed on Empire period lines. They wore pink satin shoes and caps to tone and carried dainty muffs.</p>
<p>The tiny attendant had a Victorian gown of shell pink satin and carried a wee posie. Her head-dress consisted of bands of flowers.</p>
<p>Miss E.Garnett (sister of the bride) was gowned in russet ripple crepe, the bodice of which featured a V-neck line of parchment crepe with reveres of russet and grey. A decorative bucke clasped the belt, and the skirt was composed of godets. A hat of tonings to match was worn.</p>
<p>The bride&#8217;s mother was attired in a smart gown of black phantom crepe, tastefully trimmed with magenta-hued crepe. The corsage was drape and the figure and the skirt slightly flared at a low line. Her hat was of pedaline straw.</p>
<p>A reception was held at the bride&#8217;s home after the ceremony.</p>
<p>The bride&#8217;s ensemble and those of the bride&#8217;s mother and sister were supplied by Pixie Berks, 32, Prospect-street, Hull.</p></blockquote>

		<p>So, there have been no blog posts here since July, and the main reason, actually no the only reason why neither of us have managed to cough out a single post is because we knew that if we did we would then have to update every one of the files produced to remove the script tags that blogger had so thoughtfully added (not such a big deal for html files, but back in 2001 when we started all of this we thought that XML was a much better idea and script tags and XML don&#8217;t get on that well).  </p>
<p>Still, it kicked our butts and made us, well Richard, finally do the decent thing and move us on to wordpress.  So, as we reorganise all of the content from the old site into pages and blog posts, don&#8217;t be surprised if that tumbleweed feeling turns into a short tornado. Â </p>
<p>Anyways, here we are again. Â Did you miss us? Â Even a tiny bit?</p>

		<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/05/skitters_8_weeks_on">earlier</a> my <a href="../../tag/running/index.html">running</a> has pretty much stopped other than the occasional sudden burst when taking <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/tags/skitters">Skitters</a> out for a walk.  And you know what, that&#8217;s fine.  My motivation for running was down to two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>get regular exercise</li>
<li>spend time out doors</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these are fulfilled just by giving Skitters the exercise she needs.</p>
<p>When I was still running I bought a <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=142&amp;pID=348">Garmin Forerunner 205</a> to replace the <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/main/index.do">Nokia SportsTracker</a> application I was running on my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/6110.html">phone</a>.  I take this watch out with me on almost every walk I do with Skitters, and record the majority of the route (sometimes, especially here in the built up part of Brighton, it takes a while to lock on to the location).   I&#8217;m using the excellent application <a href="http://www.montebellosoftware.com/">Ascent</a> to read the tracks from the phone and create them into a usable format, and export them to kml format for use on our <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/">maps</a> page.  I&#8217;ve found this combination to work brilliantly, and have found Ascent to be a great tool allowing me to record what we&#8217;ve been up to.</p>
<p>It also provides a summary page, allowing me to summarise the month of june as<br />

<p>We&#8217;ve got ourselves into a bit of a routine.  Generally, I do the morning walk, Richard does the evening walk and we both do weekend walks.  In reality though, we often both go out with her.  June started with Richard being away at Java One in San Francisco, so I was the only dog-walker, which obviously bumps up my numbers this month somewhat.  On top of the daily walks along Brighton/Hove seafront,  June has included walks in Stanmer Park [<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/06-Jun-09-10_03-stanmerarea.kml">1</a>][<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/13-Jun-09-13_11-StanmerDitchlingBeacon.kml">2</a>][<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/26-Jun-09-15_46-fridayafternoonstanmer.kml">3</a>], Lancing for low tides [<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/06-Jun-09-17_39-lancingagain.kml">1</a>][<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/14-Jun-09-10_47-lancingwithjkr.kml">2</a>][<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/29-Jun-09-11_19-morningpaddle.kml">3</a>],  Ashdown Forest [<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/07-Jun-09-11_32-ashdownforest.kml">1</a>], Devil&#8217;s Dyke [<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/07-Jun-09-17_45_devilsdyke.kml">1</a>][<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/12-Jun-09-18_40-DevilsDyke.kml">2</a>][<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/20-Jun-09-11_06-devilsdyke.kml">3</a>], Nymans woods [<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/14-Jun-09-15_10-nymanswoods.kml">1</a>], Firle [<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/19-Jun-09-18_46-firle.kml">1</a>] ending up at the excelent <a href="http://www.theram-inn.com/">Ram Inn at Firle</a> (a dog-friendly pub selling lovely food), Barcombe [<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/27-Jun-09-18_15-barcombebeer.kml">1</a>] (involving a beer at the <a href="http://www.anchorinnandboating.co.uk/">Anchor Inn</a>) and a weekend in Margate with Richard&#8217;s folks [<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/20-Jun-09-17_27-airshowbeaches.kml">1</a>][<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/21-Jun-09-08_58-cliftonvillemorningwalk.kml">2</a>][<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/21-Jun-09-16_14-kingsgate.kml">3</a>]</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last birthday I decided to write myself a set of &#8220;resolutions&#8221;, or more probably intentions for the year in which I was 36.</p>
<p>Those intentions were:</p>
<ul>
<ol>Attend a photography course</ol>
<ol>Eat organic food when possible</ol>
<ol>Eat local food when possible</ol>
<ol>Make the most of my Madgex ILP time</ol>
<ol>Exercise at least twice a week</ol>
<ol>Do photography projects</ol>
<ol>Visit an IFA and do a full financial review</ol>
<ol>Get a massage once a month</ol>
</ul>
<p>So, 13 months later, and looking back, how did I do?</p>
<ul>
<ol>Attend a photography course &#8211; yup, I did a weekend <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/creative%20digital%20photography.html">Creative Digital Photography</a> course at Evolution in Brighton</ol>
<ol>Eat organic food when possible &#8211; hard to quantify, but most food eaten at home has been organic, or at least local.  Eating out and lunchtimes is harder, but fortunately Brighton has a good collection of different eateries.</ol>
<ol>Eat local food when possible &#8211; see point 2 above</ol>
<ol>Make the most of my Madgex <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/ilp.html">ILP</a> time &#8211; unfortunately, the cost cutting removed this in November, but I did use quite a lot of time to investigate tools and techniques and have also presented on the topics of Photography and Visual Studio Hints and Tips, ran <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/CodingDojo.html">SQL coding dojo</a>s and a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/2008/08/sql-snap.html">SQL Snap</a> session.  Most of these have been written up on my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/blog.html">technical(ish) blog</a></ol>
<ol>Exercise at least twice a week &#8211; after a slow start, I started <a href="../../tag/running/index.html">running</a> in July following the <a href="../../tag/c25k/index.html">c25k</a> programme and did well enough with this to take part in a 3.8K race in November raising &#xA3;625 for the <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/index.php">Alzheimer&#8217;s Society</a>.  I kept this up and ran the (very soggy) <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/12/brighton_santa_dash">Santa Dash 5K</a> in December, and had planned to run the Race for Life 10K in July this year.  Training was going ok until <a href="../../tag/skitters/index.html">Skitters</a> arrived, and now running has been overtaken by dog walking &#8211; lots of it &#8211; and I&#8217;m cancelling my place in the Race for life.</ol>
<ol>Do photography projects &#8211; to be honest I haven&#8217;t done anything like the number of projects I&#8217;d optimistically hoped for, but I have worked on my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/lego.html">Lego Santa</a> project.</ol>
<ol>Visit an IFA and do a full financial review &#8211; after several years of no financial advice both Richard and I sat down with a new IFA and had a full financial health-check.  Our new IFA visits us every 3 or so months and keeps us up to date with what is best for our situation.  This has been well worth doing.</ol>
<ol>Get a massage once a month &#8211; hmm, no, not once a month, but probably every other month.  Must try harder</ol>
</ul>
<p>I haven&#8217;t got a list for this year, so maybe it should be something I reserve for even years ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>It is 8 weeks since we <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/03/introducing_skitters">brought Skitters home</a> and she has settled in well.  In that time, we&#8217;ve become really interested in <a href="http://twitter.com/brightontide">low tide times</a> (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157617444708930/">because sand appears near the West Pier</a> and Skitters can have a great run), we&#8217;ve tried out lots of treats and come up with a short list (dried liver, sausages and schmackos), Richard has taught her to fetch, and a combination of me and Richard&#8217;s Dad have taught her to shake hands.</p>
<p><a title="Richard throws the ball for Skitters by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3484474240/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3328/3484474240_42ef5b0fa4.jpg" alt="Richard throws the ball for Skitters" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>Skitters has visited Hull, and met my Dad, and she&#8217;s been to Margate and met Richard&#8217;s family.  She travels well, and settles down and sleeps in the back of the car.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/3489064039/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3489064039_6563514ee2.jpg" alt="Car travel by Richard Dallaway, on Flickr" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>We have both increased our exerise, I&#8217;ve decided not to run the 10K I was planning to in July because I just don&#8217;t have the spare energy at the moment.  I&#8217;ve tracked a lot of walks on my Garmin Forerunner watch and know that I&#8217;m averaging about 20 miles per week.  Some of the favourite spots are Stanmer Park and the woods beyond (<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/20090328StanmerParkwalkies.kml">1</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/04-Apr-09-12_39-stanmer.kml">2</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/25-Apr-09-13_32-stanmer.kml">3</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/10-May-09-16_07-stanmer.kml">4</a>), the River Adur (<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/10-May-09-12_31-adur.kml">1</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/16-May-09-12_16-adur.kml">2</a>), and any beach (<a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/26-Apr-09-07_00-lowtide.kml">1</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/02-May-09-08_03-botanybay.kml">2</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/03-May-09-15_21-reculver.kml">3</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/04-May-09-07_54_kingsgate.kml">4</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/17-May-09-12_45-Shorehambeach.kml">5</a>).</p>
<p><a title="Moonlit dog by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3498435282/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3394/3498435282_e4af039d99.jpg" alt="Moonlit dog" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re on to leads number 3 and 4 after she chewed her way through 2 retracting leads.  She now has a shortish lead, that matches her collar, for when she&#8217;s the dog-around-town, and a 10m long line for when we&#8217;re out and about and there are too many interesting smells around to let her off the lead.  Yesterday we lost her for a while as she&#8217;d gone sniffing in amongst some brambles, she seemed to have got stuck and we were trying to work out how to get her out, when Richard spotted her running off.  Somehow she&#8217;d managed to get out of her harness, without undoing it (the straps have been tightened up now!).  She ran off and ended up in a field of horses before trying to find her way back to us &#8211; which she did, covered in mud and looking absolutely exhausted.  But this goes to show that she&#8217;s not ready to be off the lead all the time yet &#8211; she still prioritises rabbits, squirrels and birds above us.</p>
<p>So, in 8 weeks I&#8217;ve spent less time at the keyboard, spent a lot of time learning how to take photos of a small dog, and have had a lot more exercise and seen the beach in a morning a lot more.  It has been great fun.</p>

<p>Richard and I have long talked about getting a dog, but it never felt like the time was right due to work commitments, the size of our garden, our work patterns etc.  This year we decided to give it some proper thought and in January decided to go to our nearest <a href="http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/">Dogs Trust</a> centre in <a href="http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/rehoming/our_centres/shoreham/">Shoreham</a> to find out more.  When we talked to one of the staff they told us that there are dogs which can suit all manner of house sizes and that we should fill in the form and take it from there.  We decided to do this, but to wait till after our snowboarding holiday in Morzine (on which probably more in another blog post).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/3355952175/" title="Jane and "Tess a.k.a. Skitters" by d6y, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3601/3355952175_65cf975a5e.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Jane and "Tess a.k.a. Skitters"" /></a></p>
<p>Last Sunday we headed off with our completed form in our hands and handed it in.  The next stage was to go and look at the dogs in the centre and see if we there any we liked the sound and look of (each dog has an information sheet telling you whether it can live with children, and if so what age, whether it gets on well with other dogs etc).  Although we didn&#8217;t need a dog that can live with children, we have family and friends with children ranging from 2 to 13 and so the children rating was important to us.  We spotted a couple of dogs we liked the look of, one beagle cross and another one, and then headed back to the front desk where Emma, one of the assistants, was waiting for us.  She told us more about the dogs, and neither of them were suitable, but she did have &#8220;one in the back&#8221; that we could find out more about.  This dog, Skitters, had been brought back that day as the chief exerciser in her new family had been taken ill and they couldn&#8217;t look after her any more.  She had been handed in to Shoreham as a stray in February, had then been adopted by her new family and handed back 3 or so weeks later.  We took her out for a walk, and got on well with her.  She matched our questionnaire well and we decided to adopt her.  She is a Jack Russell Terrier crossed with something a bit larger judging by her size.  Having made our decision the next stages for us were to take her out for a second walk, have a house visit from <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1112321">animal welfare</a> who provided all sorts of helpful information including a helpful <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&#038;hl=en&#038;msa=0&#038;msid=108468157689035866267.00044dd1c76b9dd5c73c1&#038;ll=50.821255,-0.148637&#038;spn=0.006669,0.013733&#038;t=h&#038;z=16">map of Brighton places which are and are not dog friendly</a>, and attend a rehoming talk.</p>
<p>Having done everything necessary we went yesterday and collected her and brought her home to Brighton.  We had a lovely long walk along the beach (does anyone know if sea sponges are toxic for small dogs? because she loves them&#8230;) and no sooner had we got home than she fell asleep on my lap.  After lots more exploring and sniffing around the house she seems to have settled down well and is currently snuggled up on Richard&#8217;s knees looking completely at home.</p>
