<description>After our trip to <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/pembrey/">Pembrey to learn how to parakart</a>, we decided to buy a traction kite.  And we decided to buy the kite we had the most success with on the day, an <a href="http://www.advance-kites.com/sitengine.php3?products/janus/index-en">Advance Janus</a> 3.1 metre kite.  We bought it through <a href="http://www.paraventure.co.uk">Paraventure</a> (who we did the course with).  These photos were taken when we took the kite out into the garden so we could get the lines tied on.</description>

	<description>Just for the pedants amongst you, Richard is 5ft 10, so our kite is quite a bit bigger than him.  It's 3.1 metres squared.  And should be able to generate a good bit of power in the right conditions.</description>
