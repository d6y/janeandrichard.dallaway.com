<description>Today was the London to Brighton vintage car rally, and as we didn't have anything better to do we thought we'd take a look.  The participants were pretty lucky as the day was mostly fine.</description>

	<caption>Queueing to get past the finish post</caption>
	<description>I'm not sure how much of a race as such this was.  There were a couple of guys commentating and they were talking to some of the drivers of the more interesting cars as they came over the finish line.  If there were a few "interesting" cars in a row then the queues built up.</description>

	<description>You wouldn't catch me sitting in that wicker seat at the front of the bike.  I wonder how the driver gets to see the road ahead.</description>
