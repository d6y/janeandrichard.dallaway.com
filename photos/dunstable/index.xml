<description>We headed off to the Dunstable Kite Festival (29 July 2001) and had a fun day.  It was very hot, and the breeze was stronger, and more regular than at the <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/blog/archive/2001_07_01_index.xml#4548168">Newbury festival</a> a few weeks ago.  The guy doing the announcing was very good, and explained what was happening in every demonstration/event, and gave us a real insight into why certain things were happening.  For instance, during the buggying event he explained what size kite was being used, what buggy, why he was wearing a harness - this was really informative.  All in all, we had a good day out.</description>

	<caption>The view from the car park</caption>
	<description>This was our first view of the Dunstable Kite Festival, having just parked the car.  Quite an impressive sight.</description>

	<caption>The kite club's bases</caption>
	<description>All along the left edge of the arena, the various clubs/flyers had set up their bases, and had all their kites laid out in preparation for their chance to fly.</description>

	<caption>A glider over the downs</caption>
	<description>The kite festival was held above the glider club, and so during the afternoon we got to watch quite a few gliders and hang-gliders floating back down to the club.</description>

	<caption>One man and his buggy</caption>
	<description>There was a small buggy demonstration, and in this picture you can see both the buggy and the kite.  The arena wasn't very large - being just 60 m x 50 m and so the conditions for buggying weren't great</description>

	<caption>A concerned look on a buggier's face</caption>
	<description>The expression on his face is what I expect my expression looked like <a href="/travel/pembrey/">last week</a>.</description>

	<caption>Looking more in control</caption>
	<description>The kite was powerful enough to get some good speed up going down the hill, but coming back up proved more tricky.  Apparently buggying isn't usually allowed on the downs, but they'd got permission for this demonstration.</description>

	<description>After having shown off on his buggy, the guy swapped onto a mountain board.</description>

	<caption>Even the demonstrators have problems</caption>
	<description>Despite having done really well with the buggy, he claimed not to have had much practice with a board, and then he fell off.</description>

	<description>The pink octopus was one of the largest kites on display, and can be seen here with a ray below it (multicoloured) and a glider to it's right.</description>

	<caption>Oops, the octopus got us</caption>
	<description>We flew our parastunter a little bit too close to the octopus, and got caught up in the Octopus's tentacles.</description>
