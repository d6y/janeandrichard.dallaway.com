	<caption>Statue and Jane</caption>
	<description>We saw this statue and thought that the way the figure was posed, looked very similar to the way that Jane looks when standing up whilst reading her palmpilot.  If you look at the window to the left of the statue, there is a reflection of a beautiful sunset.</description>

	<caption>Chalk drawings on the streets</caption>
	<description>Still not sure whether this was anything to do with it being "International Car Free Day" or not.  I know Brighton was supposed to be making an effort, and closing some of it's roads to traffic.</description>

	<caption>Palace Pier and the moon</caption>
