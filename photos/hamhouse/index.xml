<description><p>Marisa and her daughter, Erena, were over from Japan for a few weeks and Marisa had the great idea of going over to <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/places/hamhouse/">Ham House</a> for the day.  It's a National Trust building in Ham, near Richmond-upon-Thames.  We probably spent the most time just chatting in the Orangery Cafe which was wonderful.  We sat out on the grass, there was a jazz/swing band playing, the sun was shining, and I can confirm that the cakes are good.  Things don't get much better than that.</p><p>The house was pretty interesting: not too big, many paintings as you'd expect, but plenty of informative, friendly staff around.  I'd recommend asking them lots of questions.  Inside the house, we probably lingered the longest in the kitchens, where there is a fine display of weird implements.  Then we headed back out to explore the rest of the gardens.</p><p>Erena's catch phrase for the day was "okey dokey", which coming from a three year old Japanese girl is unbelievably cute.</p><p>A great day out catching up with friends.</p></description>
