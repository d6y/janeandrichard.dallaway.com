<description>
We started off following the Foredown route in the useful pack of trails from local train stations that we picked up at Baker Street Bikes last week.  As we got to the top of Fulking Hill though we decided that it was much too windy to continue along the route and so we decided to go back down the Devil's Dyke Road (altho we had to have a bit of a retrace of our steps as my mobile phone had managed to fall out of my bag when we'd stopped to take photos earlier - fortunately we found it again).  Total distance - 14.5 miles.

	<description>Just beyond the patch where this photo was taken, there were some really deep puddles, so deep that on the last one our feet were just in the water - nice!</description>

	<description>Rich thought that if he cycled off towards the sheep, that they'd run away.  Instead they kind of sauntered.</description>
