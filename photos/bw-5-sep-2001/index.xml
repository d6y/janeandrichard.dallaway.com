	<caption>A wall tile</caption>
	<description>The people who owned the house before us left us a lot of plants, and also some tiles.  This is one of them.  Again just testing out the various modes on the S20.</description>

	<caption>Black and white ducks...</caption>
	<description>Another thing we were left was a duck wind chime.  This photo was taken at Gain +2 and then converted into black and white and has got a bit of a feeling of grain about it.</description>
