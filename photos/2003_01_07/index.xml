<description><p>New camera, new functions... I've never had a camera before where you can adjust the time the shutter stays open for.  So I had to go and play.  Shame it's winter and very cold, but it did make for a really clear sky and I'm pleased with what I learnt.

Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to change the settings on the camera much between shots (as I couldn't feel my fingertips any more) so I need to go and play another night - when it's a bit warmer!</p></description>

 <caption>Pub and moon</caption>
 <description>The exposure time I chose was way too long for the available light.  I hadn't realised quite how much light the moon produced, so over compensated with a 15 second exposure time.  The moon was actually a crescent, not dis-similar in size to that in <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/latesummer2001/img_0585_640/">this image</a></description>

 <caption>Trees and Orion</caption>
 <description>My favourite shot, and worth freezing my hands off for.  I had to take 3 or 4 of these to get the trees in the right place, but I'm pleased with the outcome.  I've adjusted the amount of red in this image as there was originally too much light pollution visible (more than in reality).</description>
