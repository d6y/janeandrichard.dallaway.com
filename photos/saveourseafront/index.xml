Today there was a demonstration against a large development that is part of the
renovation of the West Pier.  It's a picket across the entrance of a hotel where I believe 
the plans were being discussed by the developers.  It's a bit cold and windy, but there
were enough people to make an impression, and cars where hooting their approval
as they went past.  I'm told that these plans and alternatives will be on display to the
public in a few weeks.  More information over at the 
<a href="http://www.saveourseafront.org.uk/">Save our seafront</a> site (they don't like the plan)
and also at the <a href="http://www.westpier-trust.demon.co.uk/">West Pier Trust</a> site (who do like the plan, I think).
