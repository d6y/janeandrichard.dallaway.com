Sunday of the bank holiday weekend in August.  It started off as a lovely day, and so we went down to the seafront and met Jeremy and Kirsty for a beer before lunch.  As we were sitting there, it started to spit with rain, then it started to drizzle, and then the heavens opened and it poured it down.  We decided to stay where we were, but just moved underneath the umberella a bit more and watched people running from the beach into the nearest shelter.  Eventually, the rain slowed down and we made a dash for somewhere to eat our, by this time, long delayed lunch.
