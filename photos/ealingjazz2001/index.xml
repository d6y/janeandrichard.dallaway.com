Sunday, 12 August, 2001. Unlike <a href="http://www.dallaway.com/photos/ealingjazz2000/">last year</a>, the weather wasn't so great when we went down to the park to listen to the <a href="http://www.ealing.gov.uk/events/esf/jazz.htm">Ealing Jazz Festival</a>.  It was the last day of the festival.... so it had to be done.
