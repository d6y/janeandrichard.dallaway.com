				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started following the <a href="http://www.letour.fr/us/homepage_courseTDF.html">Tour de France</a> in around 2002 thanks to sharing an office with an avid tdf fan, Jeremy. A few years later we got to see <a href="/2007/07/tour_de_france/">a couple of stages when it was in the UK</a>. I&#8217;ve maintained an interest over the years, and thought I&#8217;d share the various media I&#8217;m using this year to keep in touch.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.itv.com/sport/tourdefrance/">ITV&#8217;s excellent Tour de France</a> highlights programme &#8211; pretty much the same familiar format every year &#8211; ITV also have live coverage on their website, but I&#8217;d generally rather watch the highlights in an evening</li>
<li><a href="http://www.itv.com/sport/tourdefrance/podcast/">ITV&#8217;s podcast</a> &#8211; nothing different to the tv really, but still comforting.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00cp89g/episodes/upcoming">Radio 5 lives sports extra&#8217;s broadcasts</a> &#8211; 3 scheduled during this years tour.</li>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tour-2010/id378783445?mt=8">Tour 2010 iPhone app</a> &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t justify paying £5.99 for the official app, especially when the free taster app seemed so slow and unresponsive, so I went for this bargain 59p app instead. It is pretty responsive, seems to handle the live updates reasonably well, and seems pretty accurate and provides at a glance views of tables, stages etc. Screenshots (taken in relation to stage 4) are below for those looking for a review of this app.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/leguape/tour-de-france-2010">Twitter list</a> described as &#8220;Riders, management, photogs, journos likely to be at the Tour de France 2010&#8221; and quite a good way to see what the people in the know have to say</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Review</strong>: The iPhone app &#8211; <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tour-2010/id378783445?mt=8">Tour 2010</a> by <a href="http://www.simusoft.dk/">Simu Soft</a></p>

<p><em><strong>Classification View</strong></em><br />
This is a splash screen showing a yellow, green and polka dot jersey.  Clicking on one of them takes you to a detail page.  It doesn&#8217;t give the White shirt details &#8211; which is shame as the UK&#8217;s <a href="http://www.geraintthomas.com/">Gerraint Thomas</a> is currently wearing it, but it does show the GC, green jersey and king of the mountains, in each case offering a rider view and a team view:</p>

<p><em><strong>Stage View</strong></em><br />
The stage view changes according to whether the stage has happened yet.</p>
<p><strong>Before the stage</strong>: gives an expected start time, and highlights the interesting points (mountain points and sprint points)<br />
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1540" title="p_480_320_01FB4E84-4619-41A0-A0CA-53BD91B87F56.jpeg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_01FB4E84-4619-41A0-A0CA-53BD91B87F56-200x300.jpg" alt="p_480_320_01FB4E84-4619-41A0-A0CA-53BD91B87F56.jpeg" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_01FB4E84-4619-41A0-A0CA-53BD91B87F56-200x300.jpg 200w, http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_01FB4E84-4619-41A0-A0CA-53BD91B87F56.jpeg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 85vw, 200px" /><br />
<strong>During the stage</strong>: visual indicator of proportion of race completed, information about gaps between breakaway, peleton and any other groups along with a second page showing further details<br />
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1545" title="p_480_320_CB8CD33F-5B70-43D4-ADE4-245D39C1F85D.jpeg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_CB8CD33F-5B70-43D4-ADE4-245D39C1F85D-200x300.jpg" alt="p_480_320_CB8CD33F-5B70-43D4-ADE4-245D39C1F85D.jpeg" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_CB8CD33F-5B70-43D4-ADE4-245D39C1F85D-200x300.jpg 200w, http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_CB8CD33F-5B70-43D4-ADE4-245D39C1F85D.jpeg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 85vw, 200px" /></p>

<p><strong>After the stage</strong> (there is a delay between the stage finishing and the data updating): shows the top 3 placed riders in the stage plus the holders of the yellow, green and polka dot jerseys. A second page shows the order the riders finished in, and their time differences.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1549" title="p_480_320_2F92DE76-ADEC-4DD2-BA23-B257C82C2CC9.jpeg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_2F92DE76-ADEC-4DD2-BA23-B257C82C2CC9-200x300.jpg" alt="p_480_320_2F92DE76-ADEC-4DD2-BA23-B257C82C2CC9.jpeg" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_2F92DE76-ADEC-4DD2-BA23-B257C82C2CC9-200x300.jpg 200w, http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_2F92DE76-ADEC-4DD2-BA23-B257C82C2CC9.jpeg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 85vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1550" title="p_480_320_5D93B49E-048D-4E30-8B30-CC9BE20CD71E.jpeg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_5D93B49E-048D-4E30-8B30-CC9BE20CD71E-200x300.jpg" alt="p_480_320_5D93B49E-048D-4E30-8B30-CC9BE20CD71E.jpeg" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_5D93B49E-048D-4E30-8B30-CC9BE20CD71E-200x300.jpg 200w, http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_5D93B49E-048D-4E30-8B30-CC9BE20CD71E.jpeg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 85vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Calendar View</strong></em><br />
The calendar view shows a view of about 5 days at a time of distance, start and end points, expected start time and an idea of the profile of the stage.  Great for getting an idea of who the stage will favour.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1568" title="p_480_320_BEFFC7FB-CA72-45B9-9CDA-F1B83ED3A17F.jpeg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_BEFFC7FB-CA72-45B9-9CDA-F1B83ED3A17F-200x300.jpg" alt="p_480_320_BEFFC7FB-CA72-45B9-9CDA-F1B83ED3A17F.jpeg" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_BEFFC7FB-CA72-45B9-9CDA-F1B83ED3A17F-200x300.jpg 200w, http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/p_480_320_BEFFC7FB-CA72-45B9-9CDA-F1B83ED3A17F.jpeg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 85vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Summary</strong></em><br />
The application has a few words which haven&#8217;t been translated into English, for instance opdated, gruppe etc, but they don&#8217;t stop me from following what is going on. The application has also crashed a couple of times, whilst getting updates during the race (it updates at a different rate depending on how much of the race is left). At a price of 59p, these are issues I can live with, but it isn&#8217;t quite my ideal app, I would, and have, recommended it to others based on these issues though.</p>
<p>Instead, my ideal app would have:</p>
<ul>
<li>All jerseys listed</li>
<li>Team view for classification</li>
<li>Ability to view where a sprinters points have come from</li>
<li>Ability to see where the king of the mountains points have come from</li>
<li>Details on each rider &#8211; when a rider is mentioned, you can select the rider in the app, but it doesn&#8217;t do anything &#8211; would be great to have a fact page including their standings in the various competitions</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone knows of an app that does all of what this one does, and my extra bits, then please let me know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last November I <a href="/2009/11/dog-friendly-rest-stops-between-hull-and-brighton/">blogged</a> about the dog friendliness of a couple of places we stopped on our drive from Brighton to Hull, and back again.</p>
<p>We did the same trip again this Easter, and stopped at 2 completely different places but using a similar strategy to last time &#8211; avoiding motorway services.</p>
<p><strong>Elton</strong></p>
<p>On Good Friday we stopped north of Peterborough in the village of Elton and did a <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/02-Apr-10-15_24-EltonNassingtonLoop.kml">7.5km circular walk from Elton to Nassington and back</a>.  It was inspired by a walk named <a href="http://www.nenegallery.co.uk/blog/?p=80">Elton to Yarwell and Nassington</a> which I found when looking for <a href="http://www.nenegallery.co.uk/blog/?page_id=114">walks around Peterborough</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4486613490/" title="Flowers in the ditch by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4486613490_b7dd9dc7ef_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Flowers in the ditch" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4486623274/" title="Stepping Stones by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2721/4486623274_6538d8a7c8_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Stepping Stones" /></a></p>
<p>It was a very pleasant walk, following along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nene_Way">Nene way</a> for some of the walk.  There were no amenities where we parked, but we drove past a pub on entry to the village though I don&#8217;t know if it was dog-friendly or not.</p>
<p><strong>Saffron Walden</strong></p>
<p>On Easter Monday we headed down around Cambridgeshire and stopped at the pretty market town of Saffron Walden.  We parked at the free long-stay car park near the football ground, and managed a <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/05-Apr-10-16_32-SaffronWalden.kml">5km circular walk</a> following the walk entitled <a href="http://www.chesterford.org.uk/walks_from_saffron_walden/walk4.html">Park and Gardens Walk</a>, again found on the internet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4494796102/" title="Saffron Walden Council Offices by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2731/4494796102_c98c976b07_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Saffron Walden Council Offices" /></a></p>
<p>Another pleasant stroll, combining parkland and town streets.  The <a href="http://dms.visitsaffronwalden.gov.uk/thedms.aspx?dms=13&#038;venue=0230384">Bridge End Gardens</a> looked very nice but weren&#8217;t dog friendly so we didn&#8217;t investigate. The <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/audley-end-house-and-gardens/">Audley  End</a> Park area was very pleasant and worth a stroll.  We spotted a few pubs, cafes, tea rooms etc during our walk and would hope that at least one of them would be dog friendly, but we didn&#8217;t stop and find out.</p>
<p>So, as with last time, 2 very different places and 2 very different walks.  The Elton walk was more like our normal hikes around fields and countryside, whilst the Saffron Walden walk was much more town and street based.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend we visited my parents in Hull.  Rather than breaking the journey up at Motorway Services we planned in stops at places which had dog-walking potential.  So, armed with a road atlas, and an idea that we wanted to stop between Cambridge and Peterborough, we identified and tried a couple of spots which were only just off the route we travel.</p>
<p><strong>Graftham Water</strong></p>
<p>We stopped at <a href="http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/leisure/what-to-see/water-parks/grafham/">Graftham Water</a> on our way up to Hull on Friday afternoon.  From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafham_Water">wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Grafham Water (TL 150 680) is a reservoir with a circumference of about 10 miles (16 km). It is located between the villages of Grafham and Perry in the English county of Cambridgeshire (Huntingdonshire District).</p></blockquote>
<p>We parked in the car park near Perry, paid our £2, made use of the amenities (toilets, cafe etc) and managed a <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/13-Nov-09_14_40_GrafthamWater.kml">reasonable walk</a></p>
<p><strong>Monks Wood</strong></p>
<p>On the return trip we stopped at Monks Wood.  From <a href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nnr/1006103.aspx">Natural England</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Monks Wood NNR is one of the best examples of ancient ash-oak woodland in the East Midlands.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no car park as such, but there is parking in a layby off the B1090.  There are also no amenities.  But, there are a couple of marked walks &#8211; we followed <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/15-Nov-09_14_07_ButterflyWalkMonksWood.kml">Butterfly</a> amongst all the trees, stopping for a spot of dog distraction training (lots of interesting smells that a certain young dog was fixated by).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4120489062/" title="B1090 by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2703/4120489062_2a288fcc03.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="B1090" /></a></p>
<p>So, 2 very different walks, both much better places to stop than at a Service station.  The amenities at Graftham Water were really good but cost us £2 for parking whilst the walk was better at Monks Wood, we got free parking but had to stop at a Little Chef for toilets and cafe.</p>
