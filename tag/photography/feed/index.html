				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I went to the <a href="http://www.photoclub.fsnet.co.uk/">camera club</a> <a href="/2003/04/last_night_went_to">again</a>, and again it was interesting.  It was a competition, with an outside judge, <a href="http://www.touchingthelight.dial.pipex.com/features/jean2002.htm">Jean Holmwood</a>.  The categories were &#8220;creative&#8221; as well as open sections for the Intermediate and Advanced groups.  The creative slides included some that had been obviously digitally manipulated, and then created as a slide.  At least one of these was manipulated, and displayed to full screen and then photographed with slide film (he hadn&#8217;t noticed that one of the photoshop icons was on the image &#8211; that was a bit of a giveaway really :-).  It got me to thinking of other ways you could do this.  Then I came home and started reading a magazine I&#8217;d bought the other day &#8220;<a href="http://www.dphotographer.co.uk/">Digital Photographer</a>&#8221; for &#8220;enthusiasts and Pros&#8221;.  On the letters page is a letter asking just that, how to get a digital file onto slide.  The answer appears to be that there is a firm based in Nottingham, <a href="http://www.procolour.co.uk">Viva Imaging</a> that will do that, and if you look for photo labs in your area, check them for &#8220;digital film recorder&#8221; services.  So, at least I know that when I feel confident enough to submit images to these slide competitions, at least I will be able to do so.</p>
