				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the rearrangement of this site, I&#8217;ve spent most of today <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2009/11/08/">uploading 2991 items</a> to flickr from the old galleries &#8211; apologies if you&#8217;re a flickr contact as you may have been notified of a whole heap of (very old) activity.</p>
<p>The flickr uploader crashed on me lots of times this afternoon &#8211; it was fine this morning whilst I uploaded a whole heap of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/collections/72157600203434892/">travel photos</a> but this afternoon it just stopped responding, on at least 4 occasions and on at least 2 occasions managed to eat (or delete) some photos from my hard drive.  After a quick check I updated to the latest <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploadr/">flickr uploadr</a> and started again, but I was a bit more careful this time and only uploaded one set at a time.  I still managed to get it to tell me that 31 of 31 was 87% though!</p>
