				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Radios should be more like TVs.  Dials? A limited number of stored stations labelled &#8220;1&#8221; or &#8220;2&#8221;?  Why not have a bit of a screen, a few logos so I can select a channel and go there, rather than scanning for channels?  Anyway&#8230;
</p>
<p>I have a thing about needing a radio version of TiVo, and today Jane tempted me with a couple of URLs.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,437852,00.html
">TiVo for radio&#8217; set for UK launch</a> is a story in the Guardian&#8230; but from 14 Feb 2001.  Alas <a href="http://www.commandaudio.com/">the company</a> in the article, sounds like it&#8217;s sort of lost the way. Shame.
</p>
<p>The second, <a href="http://www.onmagazine.com/on-mag/reviews/article/0,9985,169142-1949,00.html">Bitbop Tuner is TiVo For Radio</a> is from Jul 27, 2001 sounded better, in that it&#8217;s a download for your PC.  I go for the download button but the site has an important notice telling me that they&#8217;ve &#8220;discontinued distribution&#8221;.<br />
(Amusing moment:  The system requirements list &#8220;Minimum Ram: 64MB&#8221;, fine,  &#8220;Processor: Absolutely Necessary&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</p>
<p>So it seems people have tried to make better radios, but there&#8217;s no money in it.</p>

I know we go on a lot about <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml">TiVo</a>, but this impressed me&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;d notice a problem where TiVo had confused a bunch of channels: what it thought<br />
was BBC4 (say) was actually something like the Parliament channel. This is bad, because when TiVo spots<br />
something good to record, it changes to the wrong channel and records something else.  Bah.  </p>
<p>On Monday I put a call into TiVO to see what was happening, and they said they&#8217;d look into and probably<br />
update our TiVo.<br />
Today, they call back.<br />
The problem, they&#8217;d figured out, was actually with our set-top box.  TiVo was right, the set-top<br />
box had the channels confused.  Now, I&#8217;d have expected most companies to say &#8220;we&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s<br />
somebody else&#8217;s problem, give them (your now out-of-business set-top box manufacturer) a call&#8221;, but the TiVo folk knew what set-top box we have, and gave me the<br />
detailed instructions on what to do to fix it.</p>
<p>TiVo: expensive, but in the end, good value.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spotted <a href="http://www.privacyfoundation.org/privacywatch/report.asp?id=62&#038;action=0">TiVo&#8217;s Data Collection and Privacy Practices</a> linked from another blog (<a href="http://boingboing.net">BoingBoing.net</a>) and it makes kind of interesting reading. I&#8217;m not sure whether I&#8217;m surprised by this or not, I guess I knew Tivo was capable of this as the capturing of viewing data is what makes Tivo work.  The paragraph &#8220;TiVo permits its subscribers to disable the collection of viewing information and diagnostic logs by calling TiVo toll-free at 1-877-367-8486 (1-877-FOR-TIVO).&#8221; is kind of interesting though.</p>
<p>On further investigation, CNN ran a story on the subject yesterday <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/03/26/tv.privacy.ap/index.html">Privacy group criticizes TiVo for collecting info</a></p>
