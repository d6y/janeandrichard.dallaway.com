				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was looking in a recipe book for the recipe for moussaka.  I knew I&#8217;d made moussaka before, and I was convinced that this was the correct book.  I looked in the index and couldn&#8217;t find it listed, I flicked through the book and didn&#8217;t find it.  Then I remembered, the recipe was called &#8220;red bean moussaka&#8221;.  I looked in the index under red and there it was.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the only recipe book to have this problem, in my experience recipe book indexes are often hopeless, in fact at least one recipe book doesn&#8217;t have one (preferring instead to list every recipe in the table of contents).</p>
<p>So, what should the index contain?  I&#8217;m happy for the index not to divide food into sections &#8211; i.e. starters, main, vegetable etc as long as they do that in chapters or something.  For me, the index should contain a list of food stuffs, and every recipe in which it is a major ingredient, so:<br />
<br />
lamb <br />
&#8211; moussaka<br />
&#8211; rogan josh <br />
&#8211; roast<br />
etc<br />
thus allowing me to find recipes based on what I have to hand.</p>
