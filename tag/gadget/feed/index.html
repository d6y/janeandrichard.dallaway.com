				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve gained some nice new gadgets, which I&#8217;ve reviewed over at <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/blog.html">one</a> or <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/">other</a> of my other blogs.  But, this was originally the home of gadget reviews, so here&#8217;s an overview with links to my other musings.</p>
<p><a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/6110.html">Nokia 6110 Navigator</a> &#8211; I got this phone on Vodafone in August time and its the first phone that I&#8217;ve made use of as a general device rather than just a phone.  I use the mobile internet on it quite a lot to keep up with google reader and twitter (mainly).  I make use of the GPS tracking via the <a href="http://research.nokia.com/research/projects/SportsTracker/">Nokia Research project SportsTracker</a> and have <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/user/profile.do?u=janedallaway">uploaded some tracks</a> to their new <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/main/index.do">beta community site</a> as well as listing them all in our <a href="/maps/">maps</a> section.  This has taken over from the combined <a href="http://sportsdo.net/">SportsDo</a> on an old <a href="http://www.mobileburn.com/review.jsp?Id=520">Sony P900</a> connection to an <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Globalsat-BT338-x-trac-bluetooth-receiver/dp/B00092759S/richarddallaway">external bluetooth GPS</a>.  The major advantage of the 6110 Navigator is that the routes can be saved directly from the memory card, with SportsDo they had to be uploaded over mobile internet to the SportsDo site before then allowing them to be downloaded in google maps format.<br />
The 6110 Navigator also comes with Route 66 software with which I&#8217;ve <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/route66.html">had a few battles</a> but am now getting on fine with.</p>
<p><a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/ipod%20touch.html">iPod Touch</a> &#8211; I got this as a Christmas present and I love it.  I got a <a href="http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore.woa/wa/RSLID?n=ipodtouch1&#038;fnode=standard/home/shop_ipod/ipod_accessories/cases/ipodtouch1&#038;nplm=TQ404&#038;mco=47F2EE2">rubberised case</a> for it as part of my Christmas gift but also bought a <a href="http://www.powersupportusa.com/products/ipod/ip_touch_film.php">screen protector</a> for it (after I&#8217;d managed to give it a small scratch).  Since getting this I&#8217;ve started watching a lot more video podcasts, especially to do with <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/podcast.html">photography</a>.  I purchased the $20 January upgrade and am finding the mail application really great to use.</p>
<p><a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/pixelbank.html">Braun PixelBank</a> &#8211; As I wind up taking more and more photographs with my beautiful <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/d80.html">Nikon D80</a> the ability to recycle my SD cards quickly enough is getting to be more of a challenge, especially when I am without my laptop.  So, I decided it was time to buy a portable storage unit that could read from SD and xD (for my little <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/fe130.html">Olympus fe130</a>).  It has 60GB of storage all held on a 2.5 inch replaceable hard disk and can be charged via USB and uses USB 2 for transfers.</p>
<p>3 different gadgets, all so far being enjoyed&#8230;</p>
