This led to me having a moment of realisation, as this was one of those cartoons where you don&#8217;t actually need to hear the voices and soundtrack to know what is going on, meaning that you could use such a cartoon for language studies, as you could pick up the story without having to  understand every word.  Thanks to Mike who sits opposite me at work for finding the video clip :-).
