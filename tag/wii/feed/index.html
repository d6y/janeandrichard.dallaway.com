Good enough so that, on a sunny Sunday, with three FA cup games on TV, the family managed to spent 5hr 30min playing games on it.  Good enough to cause my father to exclaim &#8220;Oh no, I&#8217;ve missed the <a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermonkeyballbananablitz/review.html">banana</a>&#8220;.

But, with my geek hat on, I also have to say it&#8217;s one of those landmark things, like the PalmPilot, TiVo, P800, Mac OS X, and probably the iPhone: it&#8217;s not that you have to have it; it&#8217;s more that you can&#8217;t justify not buying it, because of the advance it represents.</p>
