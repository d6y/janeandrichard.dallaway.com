<p>This is a test movie I put together so I could discover how to use the 16:9 setting on the camera, to see how to edit with 16:9, and how to export it. I also wanted to see how I&#8217;d get on hand-holding the camera on a cycle.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a great lesson, but unfortunately a terrible piece of video. Sorry about that. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned&#8230; </p>
<p>In the first half of the film I was cycling with the camera resting on the handlebars, using my right hand to press the camera onto the handle bars. This is bad for two reason: first, I couldn&#8217;t signal in traffic to turn right; second, the vibrations from the road through the camera has crippling effects on the recording. </p>
<p>Later I was cycling essentially one handed, which produced smoother film. It also allowed me to try out changing the filming angle. </p>
<p>Other stuff: cycling against a strong wind, while filming, resulting in me wheezing. Combined with the occasional loud sniff makes for some horrible sound. Gah. But it was a good exercise for me in blending and offsetting the sound from different clips&#8212;more so later in the sequence than earlier. Oh, and I learned that I need to oil my cycle: some of the squeaks and rattling sounds are embarrassing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>But that aside the 16:9 part kind of works. I had to jump through a few hoops to export the movie into iDVD. Although the 16:9 export from FCE has the right aspect ratio in QuickTime player, it imports to iDVD as 3:4. I don&#8217;t have QuickTime Pro, so I couldn&#8217;t use the <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305337">official Apple workaround</a> for this, or <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sith33/FileSharing34.html">Anamorphicizer</a>, so to get round it I had to pull the movie into iMovie08 and then export from that. It works.</p>
<p>Initially I was deeply unhappy with the output, especially when viewed on TV. Then I found the &#8220;Deinterlace Source Video&#8221; checkbox in the size option box from &#8220;File/Export QuickTime Conversion&#8230;&#8221; (which is where I also picked &#8220;PAL 720&#215;576 16:9&#8221; for the dimensions). Lots of jaggies in the original, all gone when deinterlaced. </p>
<p>The version here is a result of exporting from iMovie08 using the &#8220;Share/Export Movie&#8221; menu, and picking the &#8220;medium&#8221; format.</p>
<p>Duration: 4min 19sec</p>
<p>Camera: Sony DCR-PC4E (MiniDV)</p>
<p>Recorded: 13 Jan 2008</p>
<p>Editing software: Final Cut Express HD 3.5</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon we spent a couple of hours at <a href="http://www.werkshop.org.uk/space/">The Werks</a> watching the highlights of the <a href="http://nablopomo.ning.com/group/videobloggers">NaVloPoMo</a> 2007 project.  Some of the films were funny, some were sad, a lot were well thought out with a story to tell.</p>
<p>I used the video feature on my phone and recorded snippets of the afternoon, which I&#8217;ve edited in iMovie as a tribute.</p>

<p>  I don&#8217;t think I should give up the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/">photography</a> and switch to video any time soon :-).  Having said that <a href="http://node101.pbwiki.com/">Node 101</a> is a skill swap style idea to help people learn how to produce video, so if it gets off the ground in Brighton, maybe I should head along.</p>
