<p>Since <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157600018308647/">Jim broke his wrist</a>, I haven&#8217;t been to the <a href="http://www.evolutionindoorclimbing.co.uk/evolution.htm">climbing wall</a>, and I&#8217;ve missed it.  A couple of weeks ago I stumbled across information that there is a <a href="http://education.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1141162">boulder park in Hove Park</a>, and so today we went for a cycle ride to take a look.</p>
<p>It is about 3 metres high and probably about 12 metres long with areas ranging from scramble, to slight overhangs.  We spent half an hour there climbing, traversing and doing the odd scramble.  I am really impressed to have something like this so close, and available for free.  I&#8217;m hoping to start visiting on a weekly basis to have a play.<br clear="all" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, since I last mentioned <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2007/02/evolution_climbing_wall">climbing</a> I&#8217;ve progressed well.  I finished the course, having a futher 2 sessions, both of which were led by the excellent Ross who taught really well.  I&#8217;ve continued to attend every week, and so Wednesday evenings will found me in the bouldering area progressing.  This evening I had the opportunity to watch a couple of excellent climbers climb elegantly on routes that I&#8217;m troubled with.  My upper body strength is improving, as is the strength in my fingers but I still have a long way to go to be able to climb with the grace and precision that I&#8217;ve seen &#8211; still progress is progress and every week I&#8217;m managing to achieve more difficult routes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night <a href="http://www.lacasadelolivar.com/">Jim</a> and I headed off to the <a href="http://www.evolutionclimbingwall.co.uk/evolution.htm">Evolution Indoor Climbing centre</a> to attend the first of a 3 part <a href="http://www.evolutionclimbingwall.co.uk/adult_courses.htm">Centre Induction Course</a>.  The centre is about 5 minutes away from work and opens from 2pm so should be a good after-work activity.  It has been nearly 20 years since I last did any climbing, and that was very spasmodic, so this course seemed like a great way to get back into the swing of things.  The evening started with us warming up by traversing, then moved on to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowline_hitch">knots</a> and how to connect yourself/your harness to a rope for climbing before moving on how to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belay">belay</a>.  After the theory was done, we put it into practice and spent an hour or so climbing.  The last few minutes we spent in the <a href="http://www.evolutionclimbingwall.co.uk/turn_up_and_climb.htm">bouldering area</a> learning how the grading works.  A great evening, looking forward to next weeks course.</p>
