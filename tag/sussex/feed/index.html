				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whilst I was <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/31-Jan-10-12_11-stanmer.kml">walking along the South Downs</a> with Richard and Skitters early today, I was struck by how much I love living in Sussex, and how much more I&#8217;ve seen of it in the past year.</p>
<p>We first moved here in 2001, and at that time our priorities were being close to a train station, and being in the centre of town &#8211; both because, at that time, I was commuting into Farringdon on a daily basis.  Over the first year we made excursions out and about, especially when we had visitors.  </p>
<p>Over the next few years, we did quite a bit of mountain biking, and discovered lots of lovely trails which could be accessed either directly from the centre of town, or by getting on a train.</p>
<p>These days we load the dog and ourselves into the car (mostly) and head off in search of views.  Over the past 9 months, we&#8217;ve visited many areas of Sussex, from Camber, to Friston Forest and the Seven Sisters, to the River Adur.  This weekend has seen us walk around Devil&#8217;s Dyke and around Stanmer &#8211; both accessible by public transport.  This afternoon I lost myself in the hills, and dales, the valleys, the trees, and was happy.</p>

<p>We headed off for a quick bike ride today, and ended up getting home 4 hours later after a catalogue of missed turns and optimism that resulted in a 24.5 mile ride.  Our first obstacle was getting through the cyclists and spectactors watching the <a href="http://www.urbanrace.co.uk/brighton_triathlon.htm">Triathlon</a>, from then on we were aiming to do a route we used to do quite often, but somewhere along the way we missed our turn and so ended up heading along the South Downs Way for a while.  We took a look on the OS map and decided to head towards Southease railway station and catch a train back to Brighton &#8211; we even used the power of mobile internet to check that they run on a Sunday.  We rolled up at the station (after heading off down the wrong road to Piddinghoe for a mile or so) about 5 minutes before the train was due only to discover that there were maintenance works on the line and they were running a replacement bus service.  We didn&#8217;t think the bus would like us and our bikes very much and so turned around and headed via Telscombe and back to Brighton stopping at Ovingdean for a slice of cake and a can of fizzy pop.</p>

<p>We <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2007/W20070916112859.kmz">tracked our route</a> using the GPS unit on my Nokia 6110 navigator, and have added it to our collection of <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/">GPS routes</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, since I last mentioned <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2007/02/evolution_climbing_wall">climbing</a> I&#8217;ve progressed well.  I finished the course, having a futher 2 sessions, both of which were led by the excellent Ross who taught really well.  I&#8217;ve continued to attend every week, and so Wednesday evenings will found me in the bouldering area progressing.  This evening I had the opportunity to watch a couple of excellent climbers climb elegantly on routes that I&#8217;m troubled with.  My upper body strength is improving, as is the strength in my fingers but I still have a long way to go to be able to climb with the grace and precision that I&#8217;ve seen &#8211; still progress is progress and every week I&#8217;m managing to achieve more difficult routes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night <a href="http://www.lacasadelolivar.com/">Jim</a> and I headed off to the <a href="http://www.evolutionclimbingwall.co.uk/evolution.htm">Evolution Indoor Climbing centre</a> to attend the first of a 3 part <a href="http://www.evolutionclimbingwall.co.uk/adult_courses.htm">Centre Induction Course</a>.  The centre is about 5 minutes away from work and opens from 2pm so should be a good after-work activity.  It has been nearly 20 years since I last did any climbing, and that was very spasmodic, so this course seemed like a great way to get back into the swing of things.  The evening started with us warming up by traversing, then moved on to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowline_hitch">knots</a> and how to connect yourself/your harness to a rope for climbing before moving on how to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belay">belay</a>.  After the theory was done, we put it into practice and spent an hour or so climbing.  The last few minutes we spent in the <a href="http://www.evolutionclimbingwall.co.uk/turn_up_and_climb.htm">bouldering area</a> learning how the grading works.  A great evening, looking forward to next weeks course.</p>
