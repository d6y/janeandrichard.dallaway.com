<p>We headed off for a quick bike ride today, and ended up getting home 4 hours later after a catalogue of missed turns and optimism that resulted in a 24.5 mile ride.  Our first obstacle was getting through the cyclists and spectactors watching the <a href="http://www.urbanrace.co.uk/brighton_triathlon.htm">Triathlon</a>, from then on we were aiming to do a route we used to do quite often, but somewhere along the way we missed our turn and so ended up heading along the South Downs Way for a while.  We took a look on the OS map and decided to head towards Southease railway station and catch a train back to Brighton &#8211; we even used the power of mobile internet to check that they run on a Sunday.  We rolled up at the station (after heading off down the wrong road to Piddinghoe for a mile or so) about 5 minutes before the train was due only to discover that there were maintenance works on the line and they were running a replacement bus service.  We didn&#8217;t think the bus would like us and our bikes very much and so turned around and headed via Telscombe and back to Brighton stopping at Ovingdean for a slice of cake and a can of fizzy pop.</p>

<p>We <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=/maps/2007/W20070916112859.kmz">tracked our route</a> using the GPS unit on my Nokia 6110 navigator, and have added it to our collection of <a href="/maps/">GPS routes</a>.</p>
