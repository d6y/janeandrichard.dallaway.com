				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During our time away in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo, we decided to use iPhone apps whenever possible to get by. These are the apps we found useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> &#8211; brilliant for keeping light reading to hand.  The pro version is needed unless you can live with just a small number of pages.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> &#8211; for travel documents, and entertainment.</li>
<li>Built-in Maps app &#8211; generally filling the cache when we had WiFI and then using the GPS on the 3GS to find our way around.</li>
<li>The built-in Screen shot (hold iPhone menu button and power button) &#8211; great for capturing images of maps  with a route on when you have WiFi but think you might lose the map or directions out of the cache later.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.appigo.com/todo/">Todo</a> &#8211; for getting junk out of our heads so we could forget about stuff and enjoy ourselves.</li>
<li><a href="http://felaur.com/pdf/">FelaurPDF</a> &#8211; transport maps which were too large to view on the in-built PDF viewer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.concentricsky.com/products/iphone/powerplug/">Power Plug</a> &#8211; visual reference for the power sockets around the world.</li>
<li><a href="http://metro.nanika.net/index.php?p=Z">Metro</a> &#8211; for finding our way around Hong Kong and Tokyo.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.weatherpro.eu">Weather Pro</a> &#8211; use this everyday to plan for the weather.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.currencyapp.com/support/">Currency</a> &#8211; handy for converting back to GBP.</li>
<li>The built-in camera app &#8211; obviously, but useful to snap route information to look at later.</li>
<li>Sydney Travel Guide  from <a href="http://www.fidesreef.com/">Fidesereef</a></li>
<li>HongKong Travel Guide also from Fidesreef.</li>
<li>Tokyo Travel Guide from Fidesreef, again.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zuti.co.uk/">Tokyo Zuti</a> for getting around the train system.</li>
<li><a href="http://nozomii.com/tokyocool/contact.cfm-menu=4.htm">Tokyo Cool City Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.funkworks.com.au/products/transit-sydney/">Transit Sydney</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mobile-streetmaps.com/">Sydney Street Map</a> &#8211; offline map with GPS support.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/interactive/mobile-guides.html">Hong Kong 720</a> (useful before we went)</li>
<li>NHS <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/iphonedrinks.aspx">DrinksTracker</a> &#8211; for keeping score.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also had TripIt, Dopplr and TripAdvisor apps, but I don&#8217;t think we used them.</p>
<p>We picked up one paper guide: at Sydney airport we did a Loney Planet &#8220;print and bind&#8221; of a chapter of Tokyo from one of their travel guides.  This was so that I had something to use on the flight to figure out what we were going to do in Tokyo in a limited amount of time.  As a bonus, the guide was bound in an anonymous brown card, making us look less touristy if we needed to refer to it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In days gone by both Richard and I had various PDAs &#8211; we both started off with PalmPilot Professionals in the late 1990s, moved on to<a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/visor.xml"> Handspring Visor</a>s in around 2000, then Richard went the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/p800.xml">mobile phone route</a> and I had a <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/handera.xml">Handera 330</a> and finally a <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/SonyClieTH55.xml">Sony Clie TH55</a> before also going the mobile phone route.  Richard is now an iPhone user, and I have an iPod Touch and a Nokia 6110 Navigator.</p>
<p>In 2005 I blogged about what <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2005/02/haven_done_listing_of">software was on my Sony Clie</a>, and long before that Richard had listed what <a href="http://www.dallaway.com/palm/index.html">he had on his Handspring Visor</a>.   There is quite a lot of commonality between those lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email</strong>: I used <a href="http://www.snappermail.com/wireless/email/">Snappermail</a> back then, now I use either the IMAP facilities on the Nokia Navigator 6610 or on the iPod Touch.  Richard uses his iPhone but did at one stage used <a href="http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/pilot/TGpostman/">Top Gun Postman</a> to send and receive mobile email.  No additional software needed</li>
<li><strong>ToDos</strong>: I used to use <a href="http://jmjeong.com/?WP">WP+</a> to manage recurring ToDos.  Now I use <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> and the web access from either my phone or my iPod Touch</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: in days gone by both of us used <a href="http://linkesoft.com/secret/">Secret!</a>.  Now I use <a href="http://nokia-6110-software.epocware.com/Handy_Safe.html">HandySafe</a> on my phone.  With the advent of the iPhone/iPod Touch applications, I&#8217;m sure there will be an equivalent purchase coming soon</li>
<li><strong>Data storage</strong>: I used to use <a href="http://pilot-db.sourceforge.net/">Pilot DB</a> which allowed me to create basic databases and store data.  I&#8217;ve not replaced this and haven&#8217;t missed it</li>
<li><strong>Timesheet</strong>: I used to use <a href="http://www.jsankey.com/software/timesheet/timesheet.htm">Timesheet</a>, Richard used to use <a href="http://www.psync.com/">PunchClock</a>.  I don&#8217;t currently do timesheeting, so don&#8217;t have an application  installed on either device.</li>
<li><strong>Backup</strong>: I used to use Flyzip to back up to the external memory card.  Now I rely on the syncing between my mac and the device</li>
<li><strong>Games and entertainment</strong>: I still miss <a href="http://www.astraware.com/palm/default/rocketmania/?skucode=0102-000-0034">RocketMania</a> &#8211; and excellent game which worked really nicely on a handheld device.  I&#8217;ve installed some of the new iPod Touch game apps and am enjoying <a href="http://jamsoftonline.com/hangman-iphoneipod-touch">Hangman</a>, <a href="http://www.mmggames.com/">Sudoko</a> and <a href="http://www.smallware.com/">Sol Free</a>.  Obviously having mobile internet access takes away quite a lot of the need for offline document readers, for all but airline travel.  I&#8217;m currently trialing the great <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">instapaper</a> as an <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/iphone">iPod Touch app</a> to see how it behaves</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the years, the pre-installed software has improved a lot, I remember having a hard time trying to find a Palm OS application which could handle both IMAP and HTML emails.  I recall paying quite a lot of money for Snappermail at the time.  I&#8217;m sure that there will be more and more <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/">iPhone/iPod Touch application</a>s available as time progresses, and it&#8217;ll be interesting to revisit this list again sometime.</p>
