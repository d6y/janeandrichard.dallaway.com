				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week was <a href="http://www.brightonscience.com/">Brighton Science Festival</a> and we managed to get to 2 events, although we did attempt a third.</p>
<p>The first one we attempted was the <a href="http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/">Cafe Scientifique</a> <a href="http://www.brightonscience.com/programme/cafe.html">festival special</a> on &#8220;The Frog who Croaked Blue: Synesthesia and the Mixing of the Senses&#8221;. But we arrived too late and saw <br /><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3295/3306652859_2cf813b6a4.jpg" /> <br /> on the door and so had to make do with a glass of wine in Browns instead&#8230;</p>
<p>Next up was the <a href="http://www.brightonscience.com/programme/bigspace.html">Big Space Show</a> which consisted of 3 parts. The first was comedienne <a href="http://www.helenkeen.com/">Helen Keen</a> performing her show <a href="http://www.thejohnfleming.com/HelenKeen/rocket.html">It Is Rocket Science</a> which was an amusing and quirky look at space, rockets and science.<br /> <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3303/3312366472_7c7c025632.jpg" /><br /> Next up was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zarnecki">John Zarnecki</a> talking about Spacecraft I have Known and Loved which was a trip through the various spacecraft that John has worked on, including this one about which he said &#8220;I was with this one longer than my ex-wife&#8221; <br /> <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3429/3312509288_1b3cc8c55d.jpg" /> <br /> The final speaker of the evening was ex-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer_Royal">Astronomer Royal</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Wolfendale">Sir Arnold Wolfendale</a>, on The Origins of the Universe who showed us around various galaxies <br /> <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3373/3312623090_b58e9ddc10.jpg" /> <br /> All in all, a great evening of learning. </p>
<p>The last event we attended was <a href="http://www.brightonscience.com/programme/bss.html">Big Science Saturday</a>, a day of science talks and demonstrations.</p>
<p>Our first talk was The Science of Superheroes, a humourous and entertaining look into how the superheroes superpowers could be replicated in the real world. The most amazing of which, at least for me, was invisibility.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3319074600/" title="Invisiblity experiment closeup by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3326/3319074600_4320541c0f.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="Invisiblity experiment closeup" /></a></p>
<p>Next was Dr <a href="http://www.harrywitchel.com/">Harry Witchel</a> on The Secret Language of Negotiation which was an interesting introduction to tells and signs with some video footage to back these things up.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3319075414/" title="Dr Harry Witchel - The Secret of Negotiations by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3578/3319075414_28771e6683.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="Dr Harry Witchel - The Secret of Negotiations" /></a></p>
<p>Final talk of the day was <a href="http://www.badscience.net/about-dr-ben-goldacre/">Ben Goldacre</a> who allowed the audience to choose which talk he should do in a &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; style. He was fascinating, passionate and knowledgeable and we&#8217;ve since bought a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Science-Ben-Goldacre/dp/0007240198/?tag=bs0b-21">his book</a> to peruse in our own time. Highlights for me were the formulas of &#8220;how to <insert verb here> a perfect <insert noun here>&#8221; taken from the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/3318252239/in/set-72157614526851095/">Daily Mail</a>, the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/3318253009/in/set-72157614526851095/">BBC</a> and the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/3319080054/in/set-72157614526851095/">Daily Telegraph</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3318254781/" title="Choose your own adventure with Dr Ben Goldacre by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3572/3318254781_e381e18e91.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="Choose your own adventure with Dr Ben Goldacre" /></a></p>
<p>If my teachers at school, or at least one in particular, had shown as much passion for his subject as the speakers did I might have managed to leave school with a science qualification. As it was, my Physics teacher announced on the first day of our GCSE course that &#8220;as far as I&#8217;m concerned women are only here to give pleasure to me and give birth to my children and I don&#8217;t see why I should teach you physics&#8221; which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree is a great start to a 2 year course and something that affected my relationship with science. These type of events are a great way for me to reconnect.</p>

<p>Last night we went to <a href="http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/">Cafe Scientifque</a> and heard <a href="http://dsg.port.ac.uk/~nicholb/">Bob Nichol</a> talking about cosmology.  </p>
<p>It was quite a complex subject to talk about but Bob Nichol was excellent, very engaging, enthusiastic and able to explain things to those of us who haven&#8217;t studied science in over 20 years.  I&#8217;m still too baffled to consider either the supernova that will cause earth to vapourise, or the fact that there might be <a href="http://superstringtheory.com/">11 dimensions</a>.  It was also the biggest crowd I&#8217;ve seen at a Cafe Sci since it moved to the <a href="http://www.brightonlife.com/brighton/pubs/branch-tavern-33.php">Branch Tavern</a> from the <a href="http://www.the-terraces.co.uk/">Terraces</a>.</p>
<p>It was also good to catch up <a href="http://happygiraffe.net/blog/">Dom</a>, <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/2007/04/dark-energy.html/">Sophie</a> and <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/">Tom</a>.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>The Cafe Sci <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/128409">this month</a> was the most passionate I&#8217;ve been to yet.  The topic was animal testing, with the presenter,  Margaret Clotworthy (chaperoned by the Europeans for Medical Progress communications director), presenting a reasonable argument that alternatives should be evaluated to see how they compare against animal tests.  Our co-host, The Exuberant Jenny, put her hands up from the start to say she held the opposite view.  And so it kicked off&#8230;  </p>
