<p>Last month <a href="http://cayne.blogspot.com/">Cayne</a> and <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2005_11_05/206_0653_r1/">Frauke</a> visited. We’d not seen Cayne <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/nz/">since 2001</a>, and it was was the first time we’d met Frauke, so that was all just lovely. Their trip coincided with the Lewes Bonfire celebrations, and as it was on a Saturday we managed to drag the New Scientist <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/eyemodule/extremeealing.html">posse</a> out too. <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2005_11_05/">Photos are available</a>. </p>

<p>I’ll leave it to Cayne or Frauke to mention “the incident” if they want to sometime.</p>
