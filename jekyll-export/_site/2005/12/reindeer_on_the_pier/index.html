<p>This year the Pier has ice skating, reindeer and general seasonal cheer. In an unexpected twist, the ice was fake (plastic tiles, boo!), but the reindeer were real. And very cute they are too. A sign reassured us that it was all OKed by the RSPCA, and indeed, 18 month old “number 015” looked happy enough. </p>

<p>It was lovely and sunny, so we wandered back along the sea-front mulling the unnatural combination of reindeer and piers….</p>
