<p>Whilst we were in Canada last week we picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.frqncy.com/">Frequency</a> snowboard magazine, which is along the same lines as <a href="http://www.futurenetworkusa.com/publications/snowboardjournal.html">The snowboard Journal</a> which we have a subscription for. It’s another beautiful coffee-table type magazine and the issue we have (4.2) includes an interesting “UnResort” guide – heli and cat access etc.</p>
