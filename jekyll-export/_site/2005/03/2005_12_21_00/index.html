<p>2005-12-21 00:00:01, Brighton: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4350391.stm">first</a> gay marriages in the UK. Interesting to note that the Civil Partnership Act also allows for divorce, so thereâ€™s an opportunity for another first there for any couple interested in getting into the record books.</p>
