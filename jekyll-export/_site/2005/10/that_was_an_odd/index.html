<p>That was an odd weekend. On Friday I found myself back in Cambridge for the shutdown party of a Logica office I worked at some ten years ago. I was there for a couple of years, doing some funky things, with some lovely people. Itâ€™s somewhat voyeuristic going back, but it was good to catch up with everyone. </p>

<p>And on Sunday I was back at Blackfriars for the <a href="http://www.hatters.org.uk/">Hatters</a> AGM. This took me across the road from the ugly <a href="http://www.ipcmedia.com/findus/howtofindus.php">Kings Reach Tower</a>, where I worked, on and off, for four years. All in all, a weekend of my brain resurfacing lots of subconscious associations with places.</p>
