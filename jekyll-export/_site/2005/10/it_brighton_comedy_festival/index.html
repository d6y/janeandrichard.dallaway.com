<p>It’s <a href="http://www.brightoncomedyfestival.co.uk/2005/index.asp">Brighton Comedy Festival</a> time again, and today we’ve been to the only event we’ve planned for this year – <a href="http://www.brighton-dome.org.uk/events/eventdetails.asp?id=1764">Paul Merton’s Impro Chums</a>. We went to this event last year as well, and it was still excellent, with some marvellous suggestions from the audience. Quite sad to see <a href="http://jimsweeney.co.uk/">Jim Sweeney</a> in a wheelchair now, last year he was still using walking sticks to get about.</p>
