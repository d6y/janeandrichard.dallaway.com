<p>Whilst we were in Cornwall, we had the good fortune to discover <a href="http://www.bangorsorganic.co.uk/">Bangors Organic Tea Room and Restaurant</a>. Not only does it do lovely lunches, and cream teas, but it also has a couple of rooms available for <a href="http://www.bangorsorganic.co.uk/accommodation.htm">bed and organic breakfast</a>. We might just consider this next time weâ€™re down there.</p>
