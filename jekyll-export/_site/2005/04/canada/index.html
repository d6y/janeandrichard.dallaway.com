<p><strong>March 2005</strong></p>

<p>2 weeks in Canada snowboarding. We did 4 days snowboarding in <a href="http://www.fernie.com/">Fernie</a>, then 2 in <a href="http://www.kimberley.com/index4.html">Kimberley</a>. We then had a day off and drove to <a href="http://www.city.nelson.bc.ca/">Nelson</a> (which was mostly shut) before catching the <a href="http://nelson.cps-ecp.org/ferry.htm">Lake Kootenay Ferry</a>. We then moved on to <a href="http://www.panoramaresort.com/index.htm">Panorama</a> and did 2 days snowboarding, with a day off for exploring other resorts, and another day snowboarding. Our final day was spent at <a href="http://www.kickinghorseresort.com/winter/">Kicking Horse</a> enjoying a powder bowl at the top.</p>

<p>A great trip, a beautiful part of the world. Shame about the lack of snow – Fernie and Panorama look like they’d be excellent when the snow is better.</p>
