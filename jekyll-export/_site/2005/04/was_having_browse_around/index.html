<p>I was having a browse around <a href="http://www.ipodhacks.com/">iPod Hacks</a> over lunch and spotted a couple of Shuffle protectors – the <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/ivault/index.php">Griffin iVault</a> (a bit hard core for me) and <a href="http://wrappers.typepad.com/">Wrappers</a> (my favourite is <a href="http://wrappers.typepad.com/wrappers/2005/04/sunflower.html">sunflower</a>). Currently I don’t have a cover for my <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodshuffle/">shuffle</a>, although we do have an <a href="http://www.iskin.com/evo.html">eVo iSkin</a> for our main <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipod/">iPod</a>.</p>
