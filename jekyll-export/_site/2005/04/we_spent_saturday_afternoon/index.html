<p>We spent Saturday afternoon helping Richard’s Godson James celebrate his 4th birthday in the <a href="http://www.pub-explorer.com/nhants/photos/ockndoughwellingborough1.jpg">play area</a> at the <a href="http://www.pub-explorer.com/nhants/pub/ockndoughwellingborough.htm">Ock ‘n’ Dough</a> pub in Wellingborough. We stayed with him and his family overnight, and after the boys had gone to bed, ordered a takeaway from <a href="http://www.biznetonline.co.uk/northamptonshire-business-search/deans-caribbean-cuisine.htm">Deans Caribbean Cuisine</a> which was really tasty, and a complete change for me as I think the only Caribbean food I’ve had before has been at the <a href="http://www.nottinghillcarnival.org.uk/">Notting Hill Carnival</a> many years ago. Now I’m going to have to investigate the Caribbean food options in Brighton…</p>
