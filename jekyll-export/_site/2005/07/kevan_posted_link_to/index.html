<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/kevan">Kevan</a> posted a link to an interesting <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=define%3AMSG">MSG</a> article from the Observer <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/foodmonthly/story/0,9950,1522368,00.html">If MSG is so bad for you, why doesn’t everyone in Asia have a headache?</a>. This is interesting, because I didn’t know that headaches are claimed to be a common symptom of eating MSG. I do get headaches when I’ve eaten too much (whatever, too much is) but a recent work meal at <a href="http://www.cosmo-restaurants.co.uk/tunbridge/index.html">Cosmos, Tunbridge Wells</a> left me with a headache and a slightly drunk feeling – and I hadn’t drank anything other than lemonade and water.</p>

<p>From the article: “Some of the names MSG goes under are:</p>

<p>monopotassium glutamate, glutavene, glutacyl, glutamic acid, autolyzed yeast extract, calcium caseinate, sodium caseinate, E621 (E620-625 are all glutamates), Ajinomoto, Ac’cent, Gourmet Powder.”</p>

<p>I’ve spotted E621 on a few things recently, and wondered if that was MSG as well…</p>
