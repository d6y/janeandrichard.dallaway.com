<p>An interesting article on <a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk">This is Money</a> today about a <a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/small-business/article.html?in_article_id=402282&amp;in_page_id=10">Cognitive Reflection Test</a>. The questions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A bat and a ball cost £1.10 in total. The bat costs £1 more than the ball. How many pence does the ball cost?</li>
  <li>If it takes five machines, five minutes to make five widgets, how many minutes would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?</li>
  <li>In a lake there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how many days would it take for the patch to cover half the lake?</li>
</ul>

<p>I had a quick search around the internet, and discovered that I’d got 2 out of 3 right, but I probably wouldn’t have managed that in an interview situation. This might be the logic puzzles I was looking for to add to our interview pack.</p>
