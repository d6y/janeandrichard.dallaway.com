<p>Ever since going to <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/india2004/index.html">Calcutta</a>, I’ve been experimenting with Indian cookery. I recently bought <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0716020785/richarddallaway">An Indian Housewife’s Recipe Book</a> which has some great, and simple, recipes in it – current favourites are fresh spinach curry and also beef kebabs (which I use as burgers on the bbq). My only other Indian cook book is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1863960562/richarddallaway">Indian Cooking Class</a> which again has some tried and tested recipes in it. Today, Richard sent me a link to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/mostof_indianessentials1.shtml">BBC – Food – Recipes – Indian essentials</a> which seems to have some good background information, as well as links to some more interesting looking recipes to try one day.</p>
