<p>There are <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4672583.stm">sand sculptures in Brighton</a> apparently as part of a summer-long <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/inaxi-sculptures/sets/544337/">sand sculpture festival</a>. I think we’ll have to head off down and take a look later in the week.</p>

<p>Update – found some better <a href="http://inaxi.com/gallery2/view_album.php?set_albumName=2005-brighton">photos</a>.</p>
