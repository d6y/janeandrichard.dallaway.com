<p>I’ve recently started listening to podcasts on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a>. I’ve been using iPodder to manage and download them, but the most recent version of iTunes manages them as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://ipodder.sourceforge.net/index.php">iPodder</a> – is a separate application, but integrates with iTunes and creates a new playlist for each feed within iTunes. I can then just open up the playlist, and pick out the ones I want and move them onto the Shuffle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> – has a new option for podcasts, and has listed a lot on the music store. Subscribing is easy, and if you have a podcast you like but can’t find on the store, subscribing is as simple as copying the url into a browser window, and then dragging the url into the podcasts window (<a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/06/goodbye_ipodder.html">it took a while to work that out</a>). iTunes doesn’t seem to put them into the main library, so instead I pick up the broadcast I want, and copy it onto the Shuffle.</p>

<p>For the moment, I’ll run with both and see which one works out better for me in the long run.</p>
