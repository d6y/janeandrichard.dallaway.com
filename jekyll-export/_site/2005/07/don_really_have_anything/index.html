<p>I don’t really have anything to add to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2005/london_explosions/default.stm">yesterday’s explosions in London</a>. Neither Richard nor I were anywhere near the city yesterday but instead were safe and well in Sussex. At work we had <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/">Radio 5</a> streaming through the internet and <a href="http://assistantbrighton.blogspot.com/2005/07/bombs-in-london.html">like Jonathan</a> we watched slow-loading news pages arrive through our browsers whilst emailing/texting friends and relatives to ensure their safety. Another day that won’t be forgotten in a hurry.</p>
