<p>I’ve just booked us tickets to see <a href="http://www.brighton-dome.org.uk/events/eventdetails.asp?id=1686">Stomp in Brighton in October</a>. I booked the tickets online, and it took me 4 attempts to buy the damn things… and then they charged me £1.50 for booking over their “easy internet booking”. Worst online purchasing for a LONG time… Bah!</p>
