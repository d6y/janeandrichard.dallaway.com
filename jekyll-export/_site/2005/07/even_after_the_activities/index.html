<p>Even after the <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2005/07/don_really_have_anything">activities of Thursday</a>, we decided to go ahead with our plans to spend some of the weekend in London catching up with friends. We stayed overnight at <a href="http://www.lastminute.com/lmn/pso/catalog/Product.jhtml?POSITION=1&amp;PRODID=390318171&amp;CATID=4">Club Quarters Gracechurch street</a> which was really pleasant – and somewhere I can see us returning to. We caught up with <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/neelastewedding/190_9026/">Neela, Ste</a>, <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/neelastewedding/190_9042_r1/">Ash and Mitül</a> over in Greenford and got to visit both VB &amp; Sons Indian supermarket (discovering all manner of <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=casava">new vegetables</a>) and try some really wonderful Indian and Pakistani food at <a href="http://eatdrink.timeout.com/search2/view/4538.html">Five Hot Chillies</a> in Sudbury (<a href="http://www.redhotcurry.com/eating_out/general/london_restaurant_awards2005_shortlist.htm">nominated</a> for a <a href="http://www2.angliatv.com/restaurantawards/nominees_indian.htm">2005 restaurant award</a>).</p>

<p>On Sunday, after a lovely stroll over to Tower Bridge, we headed off on the <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/dlr/">DLR</a> and caught up with Suz and Greg over at their new place overlooking the <a href="http://www.londontown.com/LondonInformation/Attraction/Royal_Victoria_Dock/4bdf/">Royal Victoria Dock</a> in <a href="http://www.mydocklands.co.uk/">Docklands</a> – a really spacious airy flat with a really relaxing view out over the water.</p>
