<p>We took a cycle down to the <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2005/07/there_are_sand_sculptures">Sand Sculpture Festival</a> this evening. Nothing much visible from outside due to the high fences they’ve put around, but we did manage to get a glance from the main road. I’m sure we’ll head off during the summer sometime and pay the admission costs (£6 for adults, and £4 for children) to go and have a proper look around.</p>
