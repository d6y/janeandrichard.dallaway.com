<p><strong>Nice 2005</strong></p>

<p>We took Lorraine away for a weekend in <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/europe/nice/index.htm">Nice</a>. We travelled with <a href="http://www.eujet.com/EN/">EUJet</a> from <a href="http://www.kia-m.com/index.asp">Manston airport, Kent</a> and flew directly to <a href="http://www.nice.aeroport.fr/include/default.asp?l=2">Nice airport</a>, a 20 minute bus ride from the centre of Nice.</p>

<p>We took a walk towards the Fruit and Flower market and had a lovely wander around before it started to rain and we took this as an opportunity to grab some lunch. We headed to the <a href="http://www.venere.com/hotel/index.php?htid=16084&amp;">hotel Solara</a> and checked in. We headed off towards the <a href="http://www.mamac-nice.org/english/">Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art</a> and walked around the outside, but as it was only an hour before closing we decided to head off to the beachfront for a couple of beers in the sunshine.</p>

<p>On Sunday we headed off along the Promenade des Anglais to the Port and admired the huge boats before catching a bus to Cimiez and having a wander through the beautiful Franciscan Monestary gardens before heading back towards the airport and back to Kent.</p>

<p>Nice was a great place for the weekend, lots to do and see and I think it is safe to say that we all enjoyed it.</p>
