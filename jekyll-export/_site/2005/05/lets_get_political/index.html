<p>I was endeavouring to be fair to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/html/96.stm">all parties</a> and so kept all the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=bumf">bumf</a> that we’ve received through the letter box. The end result of this is that I can’t be bothered to read it all, and so have decided to count them instead. Not sure what this tells us, but the honour of “Most leaflets” must be shared between the <a href="http://www.mikeweatherley.org.uk/">Conservative Party</a> and the <a href="http://www.keithforwestminster.com/h/f/KEITH/blog//2//">Green Party.</a></p>
