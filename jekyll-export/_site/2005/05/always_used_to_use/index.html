<p>I always used to use BT OpenWorldâ€™s <a href="http://www.pixology.com/home/home.asp">Pixology</a> service for getting prints from digital over the internet. When I tried to do this on Saturday I was informed that the service was no longer available. Richard pointed out that there is an <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> service linked to <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-locale=en_GB&amp;pq-path=2/3&amp;_requestid=30862">Kodak</a> which does prints, so we investigated, discovered it was 14p per print cheaper than I used to pay and ordered some prints. They arrived today, so 5 days from ordering to receiving, including 2 weekend days and a bank holiday. Pretty impressive, and the quality is great too.</p>
