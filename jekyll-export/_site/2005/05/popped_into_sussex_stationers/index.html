<p>I popped into <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/Sussex_Stationers_Shop__5113262&amp;e=10313">Sussex Stationers</a> at lunchtime and spotted <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1843535173/richarddallaway">The Rough Guide to the Da Vinci Code: History, Legends, Locations</a>. An interesting concept that one. A book about the facts behind a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552149519/richarddallaway">book</a>. There also seems to be an accompanying book for another of the <a href="http://www.danbrown.com/">Dan Brown</a> books <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552150738/richarddallaway">Angels and Demons</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1843171317/richarddallaway">Illuminating Angels and Demons: The Unauthorized Guide to the Facts behind the Fiction</a>. </p>

<p>On a related note, I also noticed that there is an <a href="http://www.nerone.cc/romemtm/nuovosito/newtours/angelsdemons.htm">Angels and Demons tour</a> in Rome, and a <a href="http://www.viator.com/brochure/product_show.jsp?ID=1010&amp;PRODUCTID=1016&amp;CODE=3588DAVINCI">Da Vinci Code tour of Paris</a> and Fodor have A <a href="http://www.fodors.com/wire/archives/000905.cfm">DIY Da Vinci Code Tour: London</a>.</p>

<p>A lot of people seem to be cashing in on the Dan Brown thing.</p>
