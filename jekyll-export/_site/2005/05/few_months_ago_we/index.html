<p>A few months ago we went to <a href="http://www.indian-summer.org.uk/is_home_new.html">Indian Summer</a> and tried their Bhel Puri which was lovely. We really enjoyed it and thought we’d like to try it at home and so bought some puffed rice. All we had to do then was find a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Bhel+Puri+recipe&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">bhel puri recipe</a>. After much searching we gave up and headed to <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/the_argus/the_guide/food__drink/planet_india.html">Planet India</a> and tried their Bhel Puri, which was quite different to the Indian Summer version. Today, we headed to the new Taj food store in Western Road and found a ready to eat Sitar Bhel Puri kit, comprising of 10 puris, bhel mix, sev, chilli sauce, garlic sauce and tamarind and date saurce – this has given me more confidence to narrow down that <a href="http://www.indianchild.com/Recipes/mini_meals_recipe/bhel_puri_recipe.htm">recipe</a> <a href="http://www3.estart.com/stores/media/recipe/bhelpuri.html">search</a>.</p>
