<p>To celebrate <a href="http://www.english-wine-week.com">English Wine Week</a> we decided to take a trip to <a href="http://www.nyetimber-vineyard.com/">Nyetimber Vineyard</a>, a vineyard under <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=rh20+2hh&amp; spn=0.031189,0.041765&amp; hl=en">an hour away</a> that produces sparkling wines that we’d heard good things about and which isn’t usually open to the public. We tasted three of their wines before joining a tour to learn more about how they put the fizz in. On the way to Nyetimber we’d spotted another vineyard close by, also open for tastings and so popped into the more tourist focussed <a href="http://www.nutbournevineyards.com/">Nutbourne Vineyards</a> for more tasting. A great way to spend a bank holiday afternoon.</p>
