<p>I forgot to say thanks to <a href="http://www.visualabuse.com">Ray</a> and Helen for the poster. Helen had <a href="http://www.cinesite.com/">a work</a> meeting with <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">the film</a> director <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm1134029/">Garth</a> (that’s Mr Jennings to you) and he signed it for me. It’s great being a <a href="http://www.dallaway.com/reading/archive/lastchance.xml">fan</a> sometimes. Sad, admittedly, but great nonetheless.</p>
