<p>We visited my folks in Hull in September, and as usual took a day trip on Saturday to show Richard more of Yorkshire. This time we visited somewhere that I don’t think I’d been to since a school trip when I was 10 or 11 or so – <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/dalbyforest">Dalby Forest</a>. It’s a pretty impressive place, although not as rugged as I remember from my childhood. The most impressive thing was the tea served by Mrs Davison at Jingleby Thorn – where in the South could you get 4 mugs of tea, 2 slices of fruit loaf, one scone and jam and one scone with cream and jam for £6! Bargain!</p>
