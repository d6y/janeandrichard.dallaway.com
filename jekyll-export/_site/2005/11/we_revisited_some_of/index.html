<p>We revisited some of my old <a href="http://www.aspectgroup.co.uk/">Aspect</a> stomping grounds at the weekend. We stopped off at <a href="http://www.potemkin.co.uk/">Potemkin</a> on the way to <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/surprise/img_1698_640/">Cathy</a>‘s 40th birthday and had a few vodka shots – I had a sweet cranberry (a bit like cough medicine) and a honey (bit too strong for me), the others had mint, sage (tastes a bit like stuffing), blackcurrant (a bit like undiluted ribena), sweet aniseed, black vodka and hunter vodka. The following day we headed back into town to see <a href="http://www.davehodgkinson.com/">Dave</a>, and ended up in <a href="http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1150/24596.php">The Food Bazaar</a> which was directly opposite the first Aspect office I worked in down Gray’s Inn Road. A great trip down memory lane.</p>
