<p>Maybe old news, but I’ve only just spotted that The Economist is offering <a href="http://www.economist.com/audio/">audio interviews online</a>. They don’t quite get it, in that they are in streaming format, which just means I have to <a href="http://www.goulbourn.com/2004/09/converting-stream-to-local-mp3.html">jump through hoops</a> to get the content onto the iPod.</p>
