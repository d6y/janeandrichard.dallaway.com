<p>After <a href="/2005/05/to_celebrate_english_wine">last weeks successful wine tastings</a>, we thought weâ€™d give another one a try before the end of <a href="http://www.english-wine-week.com/">English Wine Week</a> and so headed off to <a href="http://www.englishorganicwine.co.uk/">Sedlescombe Organic Vineyard</a>. They have a nature trail as well as a shop selling their <a href="https://www.proteusweb.com/engorg/acatalog/Wines.html">wines</a>, and <a href="https://www.proteusweb.com/engorg/acatalog/English_Organic_Fruit_Juices.html">fruit juices</a> as well as other organic products. We tasted 4 of their wines, and came away with a selection of bottles to enjoy over summer.</p>
