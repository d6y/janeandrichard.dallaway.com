<p>At tonight’s <a href="http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/">Cafe Scientifique</a> <a href="http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/">Daniel Nettle</a> talked about happiness. Not in a hippy self-help way, but in a psychological, physiological, sociological, behavioural way.</p>

<p>Happiness, though tricky to measure, hasn’t increased since the ’50s despite the over-wehelming increase in wealth and health. There seems to be a distinction between wanting things and liking things, supported by the difference in our brains response to addictive drugs such as cocaine (want) and non-adictive pleasure drugs like ecstasy (like). </p>

<p>We learned a new concept tonight, that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a>. We’re probably flow junkies, and not-coincidently (?) our snowboard bindings are made by a company called <a href="http://www.flow.com/">Flow</a>. We also learned Switzerland (or possibly Norway) is the happiest country. Either way, they both have snow. 😀 </p>

<p>We picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192805584/richarddallaway">his book</a>: it has a happy yellow cover.</p>
