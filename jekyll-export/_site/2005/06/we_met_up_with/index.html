<p>We met up with some friends from Aspect days yesterday, something which seems to becoming a bit of an annual event. One of them, Jules, has spent the last year or so starting up a new business, and has just launched <a href="http://www.anagramworks.co.uk/">Anagram Works</a> in time to appear in a couple of the <a href="http://www.openhouseonline.co.uk/">Open Houses</a> in Brighton during this year’s <a href="http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/">Brighton Festival</a>. She’s made a series of <a href="http://www.anagramworks.co.uk/products.html">greetings cards</a>, as well as a <a href="http://www.anagramworks.co.uk/samples/Brighton.jpg">Brighton</a> mug (I’m now the proud owner of one of these which will be going into the office tomorrow to replace my previous, rather dull, black mug).</p>
