<p>I’ve only just found <a href="http://www.citystats.org">citystats.org</a>, which gives information and maps for Brighton. The mapping is pre-google maps so it feels clunky, but on the other hand the data is Ordnanace Survey to 100m (meters) plus photos to that sort of level too. I couldn’t find any mention of <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=297">Jedis</a> in the census data for religion, so that must have been bucketed into “other”. </p>

<p>I stumbled on this while researching the <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1145785">proposed changes</a> to central Brighton parking, and how it would effect <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1129328">our street</a>: £3 per hour pay and display parking, double yellow lines elsewhere.</p>
