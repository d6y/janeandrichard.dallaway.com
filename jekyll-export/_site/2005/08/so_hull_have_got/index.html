<p>So, Hull have got off to an okay start in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/default.stm">Championship</a>, shame about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4127136.stm">losing to Wolves</a> on Saturday though – and of course it had to be Wolves, Richard’s Dad’s team :-(. I’m glad I only had a couple of quid riding on it!</p>
