<p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/world/2004/asia_quake_disaster/">main news</a> of the day eclipsed this somewhat, but I’ll report it now… </p>

<p>Last year <a href="/2004/01/well_done_to_jeremy">Andy dressed up in a santa costume</a> and hit the sea on Christmas day. He made the local paper, which was kind of fun. </p>

<p>This year Jeremy, Andy, Ben and Kirsty all went in on Christmas Day in santa costumes. Alas, we weren’t there to witness this, but on <a href="http://www.cheekysquirrel.net/blog/archives/000342.html">Boxing Day</a> (American cousins: it’s December 26th) Jeremy called with the news that a photo of Kirsty had made it into the <a href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/">News of the World</a>. We later found out that a similar picture had made it into <a href="http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk">Mail on Sunday</a>, both national papers. </p>

<p>At the news agent I discovered just how much they’d upped the ante: they were there on the front page of the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/">Independent</a>. Above the fold. On a proper grown up paper. And a fantastic photo (but not a great scan, by me): </p>

<p>Nice work! The photo was also used in a BBC report: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4125853.stm">Brave swimmers take festive dip</a>.</p>
