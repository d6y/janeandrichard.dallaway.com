<p>“Sir Oliver’s horse came ambling home to Oliver’s abode” </p>

<p>I’ve been carrying that phrase around in my head for… a long time. Since Mrs Wilson, my secondary school maths teacher, put it in our heads as a mnemonic for remembering how sin, cos and tan are based on the <a href="http://www.mathsrevision.net/gcse/sin_cos_tan.php">ratios of the sides of triangles</a> (scream if you want to go nerdier). Anyway, these last couple of days, for no obvious reason, I started wondering about the following meaningless questions:</p>

<p>Who was Oliver? How did he get his knighthood? What had he been doing to lose his faithful horse? Did it involve trigonometry? Maybe there’s a story there.</p>
