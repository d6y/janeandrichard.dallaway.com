<p>We spent the break between Christmas and into the New Year in Morzine, staying with Jonny and Lisa at the lovely <a href="http://www.rideslide.co.uk/">Ride and Slide</a> chalet in <a href="http://www.morzine.com/">Morzine</a>.</p>

<p>We managed to fit in three and a half days snowboarding in the Avoriaz area and progressed onto our first red runs. Our favourite area was Lindarets, and our favourite runs were Combe a Floret (a gentle, winding, tree lined blue) and Tannes (quite a wide and gentle red).</p>
