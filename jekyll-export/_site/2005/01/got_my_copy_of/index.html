<p>I got my copy of the <a href="http://www.skiclub.co.uk/skiclub/default.asp">SkiClub</a> magazine yesterday, and it had a feature on <a href="http://www.mountmaps.com/main.asp">MountMaps</a> which look like quite a handy evolution in ski maps – 3D representations of ski terrain. Currently they’ve got maps of the Three Valleys, SkiWelt, Whistler and Big White. If they had them for any of the places we’re visiting this year (Fernie, Kimberley and Panorama) I’d probably buy one to see how they work in the wild.</p>
