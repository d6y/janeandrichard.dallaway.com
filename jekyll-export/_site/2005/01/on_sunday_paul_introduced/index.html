<p>On Sunday, Paul introduced us to a short cycle route that has the benefit of getting you “off road” pretty quickly. At the top of Hove park there’s a narrow route you can take up-hill which leads to the A27/Devil’s Dyke roundabout. You cross the road from there and it’s all downhill through some woods back to the London road. Short, but sometimes that’s all you need.</p>
