<p>I’ve just had lunch at <a href="http://www.wagamama.com">Wagamama</a> in <a href="http://www.visittunbridgewells.com/">Tunbridge Wells</a>. It’s been quite a few years since my last Wagamama experience, and it was as good and tasty as I remember. I can see there being lots of visits to the <a href="www.wagamama.com/brighton/">Brighton</a> one when it opens later this month.</p>
