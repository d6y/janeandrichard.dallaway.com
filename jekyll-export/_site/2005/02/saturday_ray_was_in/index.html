<p>Saturday: <a href="http://www.visualabuse.com/">Ray</a> was in Brighton. The band heâ€™s in, <a href="http://www.loopjoy.com/">loopjoy*</a>, were playing at the <a href="http://www.ents24.com/web/venue/2376/Brighton/The_Freebutt.html">Freebutt</a> pub. We went along, and loopjoy (not sure if the * is mandatory) really are quite lovely live. The venue is great too: small but friendly, with a sound engineer who looked constantly baffled or hassled.</p>
