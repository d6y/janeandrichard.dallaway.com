<p>I spotted this guy waiting outside the Apple Store in Regent Street during our <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2005_02_12/">day trip to London</a> yesterday. We left the Apple store with an <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodshuffle/">early birthday present for me</a>, which I guess means that Richard gets custody of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">20GB iPod</a> we bought <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/ny2004/index.html">in New York</a> last year.</p>
