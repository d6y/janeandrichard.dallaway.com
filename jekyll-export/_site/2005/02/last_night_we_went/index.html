<p>Last night we went to the <a href="http://www.komedia.co.uk/">Komedia</a> to see <a href="http://www.stewartlee.co.uk/main.html">Stewart Lee</a>. He was very good, despite having been to the <a href="http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/6416">funeral</a> of <a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/mhardee.html">Malcolm Hardee</a> yesterday. He finished his normal act, took a break and came back to finish with a recital of some prose he wrote for the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0091889243/richarddallaway">Sit-down Comedy: Stand-ups Swap the Stage for the Page</a> book, edited by Malcom Hardee.</p>
