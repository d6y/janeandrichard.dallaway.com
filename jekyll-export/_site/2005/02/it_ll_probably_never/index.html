<p>It’ll probably never happen, which is a shame: “The holiday resort, named <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/southern_counties/3261343.stm">Pleasure Island</a>, would be based two thirds of a mile off the coast of Brighton, between the city’s two piers”. </p>

<p>Does anyone else mentally picture a man in a white suit greeting guests: “<a href="http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/ShowMainServlet/showid-679/Fantasy_Island/">Welcome to Pleasure Island</a>“</p>

<p>“An area of the development would also be set aside for low cost housing and flats” which I can only assume is designed to be the equivalent of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_town">factory town</a> for anyone working on this luxury resort.</p>
