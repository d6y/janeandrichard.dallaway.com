<p>I’ve just been reading a <a href="http://www.goneboarding.co.uk/Forum/ShowThread.aspx?ThreadID=12531">thread on Gone Boarding</a> about a <a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/reprint/330/7486/281">study about helmet wearing for boarders and skiers</a>. I don’t have a helmet at the moment for snowboarding, but yet I do wear one when I’m on my mountain bike, both on and off road. Somehow that doesn’t seem to make much sense, I’ve banged my head more often snowboarding than I have on the bike. Maybe that’s another thing I should add to my shopping list next time I’m at a resort.</p>
