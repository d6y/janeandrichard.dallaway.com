<p>I’ve added another snowboarding blog to my read list – <a href="http://www.thefunkydrummer.blogspot.com/">The Funky Drummer</a> is a <a href="http://www.goneboarding.co.uk/">GoneBoarding</a> guy who is working and boarding in Japan at the moment. It’s a fun read, both for information on life and snowboarding in Japan.</p>
