<p>Productivity thought: I was just writing an email, and I wasn’t sure about the spelling of a word. It was all over in a few milliseconds, but what I found my fingers doing was to start typing the first few letters of the word and then I pressed CTRL+Space. If you use an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">IDE</a> which has <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/help/editing/codecompletion.html">“code completion”</a>, you’ll will know where I’m going here… I was expecting a list of matching words to appear, from which I could pick the one I intended to use. Of course, it didn’t. I think it’d be a good feature to have, and would really mean that I never have to learn how to spell.</p>
