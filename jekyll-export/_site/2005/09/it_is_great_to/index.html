<p>It is great to see so many <a href="http://shop.ipodworld.co.uk/iPodWorldSite/category/iPodShuffle/">great add on products</a> for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a> â€“ Iâ€™m quite taken with these <a href="http://shop.ipodworld.co.uk/iPodWorldSite/product/iPodShuffle_Speakers/PG19.htm">PodGear Pocket Party Shuffle Speakers</a>. Admittedly I donâ€™t need any as weâ€™ve still got some <a href="http://www.argos.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10001&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=3801&amp;productId=160821&amp;Trail=C%24cip%3D29001.Portable%2Bspeakers&amp;categoryId=29001&amp;clickfrom=name">more normal portable speakers</a> that work admirably well. Needing is different to wanting though ðŸ™‚</p>
