<p>I didn’t find <a href="http://www.bottledbeer.co.uk/?beerid=997">Kwak</a> (8%) beer to be “very smooth and spritzy”. Although I do like the taste of strong Belgium beer, such as the Chimay (scary at 12%), this one had an initial taste of neat spirit. Not something I look for in a beer. But that’s me: <a href="http://www.paulbooth.com/">Paul</a> liked it, and with a great comedy name, it had to be tried.</p>
