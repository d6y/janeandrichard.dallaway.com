<p>Last night, at the <a href="http://www.halfmoon.co.uk/">Half Moon</a> pub in Putney, a friend’s band took to the stage: headlining for the first time. They’re called <a href="http://www.hostessmusic.com">Hostess</a>.</p>

<p>What sort of music? “Hostess combine glorious trip hop beats with delicate melodies to refresh your soul.” You can listen at <a href="http://www.hostessmusic.com/music.html">http://www.hostessmusic.com/music.html</a>.</p>
