<p>The photo above is of an in-flight information screen on a flight <em>from</em> the UK. Notice anything wrong</p>

<p>with that picture? It’s difficult to make out but the aircraft in the middle of the screen is stuck on</p>

<p>route <em>into</em> the UK. Notice also the system crash log text at the top of the image. Not very reassuring, but</p>

<p>as we were already at 30,000ft or something, there wasn’t much point worrying about it.</p>
