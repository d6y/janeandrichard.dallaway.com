<p><a href="http://www.wadaiko-yamato.com/NewFiles/english-site2001/main-e.html">Wadaiko Yamato</a> – a Japanese drumming phenomenen – are performing at the Peacock Theatre in London at the moment. We went last night with some friends and were all extremely impressed. I didn’t know what to expect never having seen any Japanese drumming shows before but it was far more lively and humorous than I had expected. There are some very talented people in the show – and they are all very fit too.</p>

<p>So, if you see adverts for a Wadaiko Yamato show near you – take the chance and go and see it.</p>
