<p>We got talking in the office today about Daleks, those Dr Who nasties who used to have me hiding behing the sofa (I was only about 5 at the time), and I remembered seeing a few web sites dedicated to building a Dalek last year when the shop opposite our old office had a Dalek for sale. We tried to get our company to buy one for the office reception, but it didn’t happen. Here are a couple of links which might be of interest:</p>
