<p>So I’ve been in San Francisco for JavaOne for three or four days now. Lots of fun stuff, techy stuff… but I do like the circus elements:</p>

<p>a bunch of 20 or 30 bikers on Harleys circling the conference centre on the first day; the guy on a unicycle teaching the crowd how to juggle; the biplanes flying over with vendor messages; having t-shirts shot at us; watching my first ice hokey game (didn’t understand a thing); keynote talks that start with comedy sketches based on Survivor; song and some dance; keynote speaches that start with half an hour of Taiko drumming (Taiko drumming twice in five days.. pretty good, eh?); the opportunity to tell vendors that you hate their product… you get the idea.</p>

<p>The free beer is good, too</p>
