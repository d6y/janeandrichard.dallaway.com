<p>We spent this afternoon at the <a href="http://www.middlesexshow.com">Middlesex Show</a>. As well as having the usual stalls, it had a small farm exhibit with donkeys, turkeys, ducks and other such hot looking animals, it had a stage with an atrocious singer on, and it also had some equine events. We watched some of the <a href="http://www.middlesexshow.com/areas/equine.htm#Scurry">Scurrey racing</a> but the highlight for us was probably watching the <a href="http://members.aol.com/moderndogs/home.htm">Cleverdogs</a> events. We’ve seen this sort of event at Crufts (shown on the tv) before and this time we got to watch it for real. It was a really hot afternoon, and by the time one of the dogs</p>

<p>made it into the 3rd/4th place playoffs in the Division 1 event, the poor thing was just too hot to really be bothered. The dogs and handlers work really hard and they produced an excellent show for the spectators.</p>
