<p>Never watch a film that you know the ending of. That’s usually Richard’s view of films. I don’t agree with that totally, as it is often interesting to see how the book gets interpreted. Bridget Jones’s Diary is a book I read many years ago, and enjoyed (in a light reading kind of way – I read it on a flight to Kenya). The film is pretty well put together, and flows along nicely. It <em>was</em> interesting to see how you can turn a book written as a diary into a film – it handles it well. It’s a fun film, no deep meaningful experience, but fun. I enjoyed it, it made me laugh.</p>
