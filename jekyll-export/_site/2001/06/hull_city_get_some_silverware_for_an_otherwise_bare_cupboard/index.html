<p>From the <a href="http://www.hullcityafc.net">official web site</a> (reproduced in full as there is no archive of old Hull City stories):</p>

<p>_“Last season may have ultimately ended in disappointment, but manager Brian Little and his players will still have some silverware to show for their incredible efforts.</p>

<p>The club have been awarded the 2000/01 PFA Sir Bobby Moore Fair Play Award, which is given to the team with the best on-field disciplinary record during the course of the campaign. The fact that Brian and his team have won the award ahead of all the other Nationwide League and Premiership clubs is a big tribute within itself.</p>

<p>PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor will present the trophy at Boothferry Park prior to a game next season.”_ </p>

<p>Well done Hull. It might not be promotion, but at least it’s something!</p>
