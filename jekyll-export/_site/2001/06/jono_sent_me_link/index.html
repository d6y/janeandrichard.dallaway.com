<p>Jono sent me a link to <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/300miles/">300 Miles High</a> — a collection of NASA images</p>

<p>taken from orbit. He knew I’d like it because I have a collection of similar images in my copy of</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0792237145/richarddallaway">Orbit: NASA Astronauts Photograph the Earth</a>. </p>

<p>The good thing about the book is that it has the captions to go with the images, explaining what you’re looking at (“The Trans-Siberian Railroad draws a line through the April snow east of the Ural Mountains”…. or “Each of these green circles is 200 acres of farmland”… or “…this is a rare clear view of Tokyo — 30 million people compressed into the ancient Japanese heartland, the Edo Plain of Honshu”… etc, etc, only the descriptions are typically two or three paragraphs, not one sentence). Shame the web site doesn’t have the captions.</p>
