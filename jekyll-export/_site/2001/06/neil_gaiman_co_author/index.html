<p>Neil Gaiman (co-author with Terry Prachett of “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552137030/richarddallaway">Good Omens</a>” – a book I thoroughly enjoyed both times I read it) has a <a href="http://www.americangods.com/journal/journal.asp">blog</a>. It is well written, funny and well worth reading and covers his experiences during his promotional tour and book signings for his new book “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747274231/richarddallaway">American Gods</a>“. He is currently in the US, but has <a href="http://www.americangods.com/otr/otr.asp">book signing dates</a> booked in the UK and in Canada in July.</p>
