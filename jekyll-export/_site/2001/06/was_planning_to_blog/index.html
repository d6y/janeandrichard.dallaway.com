<p>I was planning to blog lots while I was in San Francisco, but <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> doesn’t work very well on Netscape running on Sun hardware. So if I can remember anything, I’m going to try to blog a few things over the next few days.</p>

<p>I flew with <a href="http://www.virgin-atlantic.com">Virgin Atlantic</a>, which was OK. Good selection of films on the flight, oh-so-tempting option to make phone calls, and a selection of early 90s games to play. Shame my game controller didn’t work on the flight out or the flight back.</p>

<p>Caught up on some movies on the flights: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0212346">Antitrust</a> (fun, glad I didn’t bother seeing it at the cinema), <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0212346">Miss Congeniality</a> (ditto) and Disney’s <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120855">Tarzan</a> (excellent). In San Fran I saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0126029">Shrek</a>, which you should go and see if you like <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0126029">Toy Story</a>-style movies.</p>

<p>I also got to see a film called <a href="http://www.imax.com/films/distribution/extreme.html">Extreme</a> in the IMAX. Being towed out to surf 20-60 foot waves… snow boarders with a death wish… climbing frozen waterfalls with no ropes. Mmmm.</p>
