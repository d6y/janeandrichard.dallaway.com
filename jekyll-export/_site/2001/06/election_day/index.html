<p>It’s a general election day in the UK today, and I’ve still not fully decided who to vote for yet. I <em>will</em> vote, but will probably decide as I walk to the polling station on my way to work. Even the <a href="http://www.whodoivotefor.co.uk/">Who Do I Vote For</a> website couldn’t help me decide who I should vote for as it told me 2 of them were of equal relevance to me. I could always try and get tactical with my voting (<a href="http://www.tacticalvoter.net/">Tactical Voter</a>) but for <a href="http://www.tacticalvoter.net/tactical/Results.tmpl?sectormatch=&amp;iebugfix=074502&amp;db=databases/busi.db&amp;display=sector&amp;geskudata=0&amp;max=50&amp;wordmatchtype=eq&amp;fieldinputname=Constituency~T&amp;searchcriteria=Ealing%2520Acton%2520%2526%2520Shepherd%2527s%2520Bush">my area</a> they have no recomendation as it is a “safe” labour seat. So, if I want to vote for someone other than Labour, my vote won’t really count for much (we don’t have proportional representation in the UK yet – sign <a href="http://callfordemocracy.org/vote.html">this petition</a>). The major parties just don’t see that different any more, there aren’t huge gaps between them at the moment.</p>
