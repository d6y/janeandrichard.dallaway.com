<p>Good tapas, good atmosphere.</p>

<p>La Mancha on Putney High Street, London has a good selection of good quality tapas, all served in a relaxing atmosphere – if you don’t look out of the windows and see the London buses go past you could almost believe you were in Spain. Last night our tapas choices were: Patatas Bravas (an obvious choice), paella, Scallops wrapped in bacon and served with lobser sauce, Lamb kebabs and an avocado, mozarella and tomato salad. All of which were very tasty, and all washed down with a couple of San Miguels.</p>
