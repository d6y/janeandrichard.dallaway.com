<p>It’s sometimes interesting to see what people read on the tube in a morning. This morning there were 2 people reading Metro (the free London newspaper), one guy reading one of the broadsheet newspapers, a guy reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140293450/richarddallaway">Nick Hornby’s “About a Boy”</a>, a guy reading a biography about Tony Hancock (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/009960941X/richarddallaway">When the wind changed, The life and death of Tony Hancock by Cliff Goodwin</a>), one reading a Java book (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201746220/richarddallaway">J2EE Technology in Practice</a>) and one lady filling in London Underground refund forms (2 or 3 of them).</p>

<p>Every now and again, there are some more unusual books to be seen, like the Tony Hancock example this morning. A few months ago now I saw a guy reading “Mein Kampf” by Adolf Hitler. It was a big book, much bigger than I’d expected (694 pages according to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0395083621/richarddallaway">amazon</a>). I knew the book existed – we’d learnt about it at school in history (that upset my Dad as what I called history, he remembered), but I’d expected it to be some short propaganda booklet, not a 3inch think paperback.</p>
