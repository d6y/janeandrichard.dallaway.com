<p>Richard is in San Francisco this week at the <a href="http://servlet.java.sun.com/javaone/index.jsp">JavaOne</a> conference. I spoke to him this morning and he said that the first day had gone well, although heâ€™d forgotten how intense it all was. There are 20,000 geeks there this year, and amazingly enough he bumped into one of the guys I used to work with at Speedwing Logica many years ago. The conference lasts all week, and there are loads of different talks and events to go too.</p>
