<p>We bought and dressed our Christmas tree last weekend. I’ve never had a real Christmas tree before (in fact, I’ve never owned a tree before as this is the first year that I’ll be spending Christmas at my house rather than at my folks’) and so it’s all quite exciting (okay, not really exciting but different anyways).</p>

<p>It’s not all that easy to tell from this picture, but the tree is only about 1.5 feet tall. We bought one in a pot in the hope that we can convince it to live.</p>
