<p><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> have made the last 20 years of Usenet news available of searching.</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups">Searching on your own name</a> brings back some interesting things. In my case, things I’d forgotten about. It seems that in 1989 I was posting in comp.ai.neural-nets. In the first half of the 1990s I was spending a lot of time writing LaTeX macros, by 1995 I was worried about Pro*C and Oracle, but by 1996 everything was web related.</p>

<p>The first result from google for me is a posting to rec.pets. I had no idea what it was about, but a <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:brian%40ucselx.sdsu.edu&amp;hl=en&amp;rnum=6&amp;selm=1990Nov12.190542.11114%40ucselx.sdsu.edu">bit of digging</a> revealed that some one in San Diego was offering to digitize pictures of a cat for me. In the days when scanners were not commonplace.</p>

<p>There’s a nice write up about <a href="http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html">what google have dug up</a> from the archive.</p>
