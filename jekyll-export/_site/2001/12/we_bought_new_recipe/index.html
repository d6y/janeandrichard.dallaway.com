<p>We bought a new <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/books/reviews/jane/lowfatlowsugar.xml">recipe book</a> a couple of weeks ago, and it’s full or really tasty recipes, and they’re healthy too. The recipes are designed to be low fat and low sugar, and best of all tasty. We’ve tried 5 or 6 recipes so far, and only one of them was slightly dissapointing, the others have been great.</p>
