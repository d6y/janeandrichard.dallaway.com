<p>One of the programmes that <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml">Tivo</a> started to record for us as one of its suggestions is <a href="http://www.stargate-sg1.com/">Stargate SG1</a>. We ignored them for a while, generally we don’t like the whole film spin off thing, but then decided to give it a go one day when there wasn’t much else worth watching around. And now we’re hooked. Fortunately for us Tivo finds us lots of them, both from <a href="http://www.channel4.com/">Channel 4</a> and from <a href="http://www1.sky.com/skyone/">Sky One</a> (although this does mean that we watch them in a strange order). I’ve just been taking a look through the <a href="http://www.stargate-sg1.com/home/episodes/index.html">episode guide</a> and know I’ve never seen any of Season One. Must look out for that some point. And if you’ve never seen any Stargate SG1 it’s kind of a cross between the X-files and Star Trek, and very watchable.</p>
