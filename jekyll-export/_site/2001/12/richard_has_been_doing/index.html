<p>Richard has been doing some work on the photos section of the site over the last couple of weeks. This has meant a bit of a delay getting some of the photos onto the site. Today I’ve put another 3 albums up. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622760966180/">first</a> is from the 13th December when Joe came down and we had a “photo play day” (too cold really if truth be told). The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622636613235/">second</a> are just some shots I took in the Churchill Square shopping centre of the decorations. And the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622759328212/">last</a> are from our day out along the coast yesterday with my parents (who have come down for Christmas).</p>
