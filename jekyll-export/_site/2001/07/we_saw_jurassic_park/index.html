<p>We saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0163025">Jurassic Park III</a> on Friday. Yeah, the dinosaurs look a bit better, but don’t bother. No story, or what story there is you’ve seen before. Bah. </p>

<p>By chance we were very bored on Saturday (more about that later) and caught the original <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0107290">Jurassic Park</a> on TV and the contrast was striking: that film is just so much better than JP3.</p>
