<p>We went for a wander down Tottenham Court Road yesterday to look for new gadgets to replace my stolen ones. We didn’t buy anything, and to be honest I was a bit dissappointed with what was on offer.</p>

<p>After the trouble I had in the first place choosing which mp3 player to buy (read the <a href="/2001/05/new_toy_for_jane">blog</a>) I’ve decided to try and find a good, small, digital radio. Whilst this may sound like an odd choice, my reasoning is that in around a months time I wont be spending as much of my travelling time underground (assuming the move to Brighton goes ahead) and so will get radio reception for the majority of the time. I was looking at the RDS models (so that I wouldn’t need to re-tune on my journey) but they are quite large, so I’ll probably go for a small, standard digital radio insead with a good supply of pre-sets.</p>

<p>We also took a look at new PDAs, and they are really uninspiring. All of the Palm OS ones are still the same old thing, nothing much seems to change from one release to the next. The Visor Edge is a nice looking machine, and I also had a play with a Sony Clie – I’ll be interested in looking at the colour one when it is released over here – but other than that, nothing of interest.</p>

<p>Probably the most inspiring things we saw were some prototype Japanese phones that a shop was using to get opinions. They were really small, light and yet had a large screen diplay. Oh and they were colour. They should be on sale over here in about a years time.</p>
