<p>Yesterday Cathy sent me this URL: <a href="http://www.seethru.co.uk/games/randomURL/">http://www.seethru.co.uk/games/randomURL/</a>. It’s a site that redirects you to a random .COM web site based on a word plucked from a dictionary at random. It’s my kind of a site… because for a while now I’ve been plucking <a href="http://www.dallaway.com/randimg/view">random pictures</a> from the internet based on dictionary words.</p>
