<p>We’re hoping to go the Brighton Kite Festival later on this month, and I was having a look at the event website this morning. One activity of the festival that really caught my eye was <a href="http://www.brightonkitefest.free-online.co.uk/festival/bmiss.htm">The Bearly Made It Skydive Squad</a>. This sounds like lots of fun, and I particularly like the footnote: </p>

<p><em>“BMISS operates an equal opportunities policy: as long as it’s a cuddly toy, we’ll parachute it – monkeys, cows, rabbits… even pigs might fly! You name it – we’ve ‘bunged’ it!!</em></p>
