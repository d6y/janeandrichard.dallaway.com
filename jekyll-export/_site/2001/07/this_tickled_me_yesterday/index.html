<p>This tickled me: yesterday I had to pop to the shops, and on the high street there were a few volunteers from some animal welfare group rattling collection tins, looking for donations. I walked past one who asked if I’d spare some time to help with animal welfare, and at that precise moment a dog let out an almighty yelp as a woman in a wheelchair ran over it’s paw. The guy with the tin didn’t even go and look at the dog. Pah.</p>
