<p>Yesterday we went up a near-by hill in search of a breeze to fly our <a href="http://www.spirit-of-air.demon.co.uk/sabre.html">new kite</a>. We didn’t find a strong enough wind, but we did find good views of the <a href="http://www.dallaway.com/photos/londoneye/">London Eye</a> and the Millennium Dome. </p>

<p>We decided to head off and find the Newbury Kite Festival at</p>

<p><a href="http://www.multimap.co.uk/map/browse.cgi?client=europe&amp;overviewmap=ap&amp;addr1=&amp;width=700&amp;client=europe&amp;addr2=&amp;addr3=&amp;pc=&amp;db=hcgaz&amp;cname=United+Kingdom&amp;X=451119&amp;Y=167680&amp;scale=100000&amp;place=Thatcham,+West+Berkshire&amp;coordsys=gb">Thatcham</a>, figuring these guys would probably have picked a location for a festival where there’s likely to be a good wind. Actually, the wind wasn’t that great for us beginners, but we did get our kite off the ground. </p>

<p>The first picture, above, shows some formation flying. We saw quite a bit of this… all set to music, of course.</p>

<p>The second picture is of one of the music structures placed around the festival. It’s a statue with strings, and the strings sound as the wind passed through them. Cool.</p>

<p>We also saw huge parafoil kite (tied down to a car), stacks, kite buggies, kites fighting, and … that’s all I can remember.</p>
