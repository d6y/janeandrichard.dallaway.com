<p>Well, after having been back from our trip to New Zealand for 6 months, we finally got around to capturing the video we took onto the PC. This means that as well as having 10 Gigabytes of avi files to edit, we’ve also got some new photos to add to this site. So, we’ve now got a re-designed <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/nz2001.html">New Zealand</a> section on this site, complete with loads of <a href="/travel/nz/nz.xml">photos</a>.</p>
