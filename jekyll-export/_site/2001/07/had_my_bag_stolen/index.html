<p>I had my bag stolen from the Hogshead pub in Cowcross street, near Farringdon station in London yesterday. It’s a really nasty experience and I lost everything, cash, cards, tube pass, keys, phone, <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/visor.xml">visor</a>, <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/soundsgood.xml">mp3 player</a>, <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/headphones.xml">headphones</a>, <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/eyemodule.xml">eyemodule</a>. The most annoying thing is that the pub has CCTV, and it has a camera which was pointing directly at where I was, but they don’t bother to put tapes in and record the pictures. They just had the picture of the bar visible so they could see how busy they were. The police weren’t very impressed when they found that out. They recommend not bothering to drink there again, as there are many other pubs to choose from.</p>

<p>So, I guess in the short term I’ll be fishing the old PalmPilot Professional out of the loft again to make my journeys to work less boring, at least with an electronic gadget I can catch up on the news, read emails etc. I’ve got a bit used to the 8MB of storage I get on the visor so shrinking back to 1MB might be a bit tricky. But, I guess I’m in the market for a new PDA, not sure which to go for so I’m planning to do some research and find out which are the best to be had now.</p>
