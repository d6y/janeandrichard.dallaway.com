<p>Well, I survived 3 rounds of redundancies, but the 4th was just too much to hope for, and so I was made redundant on Monday along with 26 others (of those 10 were voluntary). I’d been there for 2 years, so at least I’m entitled to the government statutory payment of 240GBP for each of those years. Wow! I’m rich.</p>

<p>So, I’m not being asked to work my notice, and so am getting to spend more time in Brighton. I spent Tuesday sleeping and generally mooching around the house. On Wednesday I went into London to meet up with some friends for lunch, visited the office and cleared up my work pc, and went to see my Financial Advisor (who still managed to con some money out of me – incredible). Yesterday I started doing some technical playing (big thanks to Paul for lending me his laptop for a while) – <a href="http://www.php.net/">php</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">mysql</a>. And today I’ve met up with another redundant person this morning to discuss some work we might do together, and then I had lunch with one of the survivors in a lovely pub in Brighton (The George in Trafalgar Street – only serves vegetarian food, and the quality of that food is great) before she dragged me around some of the antique shops in the North Laines.</p>

<p>All in all, it ended as a far better week than it began.</p>
