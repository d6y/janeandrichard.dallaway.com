<p>After taking a couple of mountain bikes for a test ride (<a href="http://www.yhaadventure.co.uk/html/bike.htm">The Bike Chain</a> at YHA Adventure still do this – you leave a piece of photo id and a credit card and they’ll let you take your prospective new bikes out. Fantastic service) we walked down to Marine Parade to watch the cars arriving in the London to Brighton Vintage car rally. A wide selection of old cars take part in this rally, and some of them seemed to manage the drive better than others – one seemed to give up around 20 metres from the finish line.
