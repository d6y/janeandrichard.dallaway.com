<p>We went to Lewes on Monday night to experience the <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/lewes_fireworks/">Bonfire Night</a> festivities. There are 5 different Bonfire Societies who make effigys, costumes and loads and loads of flaming torches. There are 31 different street processions – we saw 5 or so of them, and they were fairly impressive. We watched the Waterloo bonfire start and then headed off back towards the car and found an excellent view across the 5 different firework displays. We didn’t really have a plan, but just wandered around. Next year, we’ll probably organise ourselves a bit better and learn from this year.
