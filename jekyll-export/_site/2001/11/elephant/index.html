<p>I’ve known about the <a href="http://www.gpsdrawing.com/info.htm">GPS Art</a> web site for a while, but I didn’t realize that there was a <a href="http://www.gpsdrawing.com/gallery/land/belephant.htm">Brighton Elephant</a> or that it had made it as a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/in_depth/sci_tech/2000/dot_life/newsid_1595000/1595670.stm">BBC News story</a>. Must have been a slow news day.</p>
