<p>A friend spotted this news article in the Mirror about the Lewes Bonfire Night – <a href="http://mirror.icnetwork.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=11410651&amp;method=full">“WAR ON TERROR: BINFIRE NIGHT Muslim outrage at Laden burning”</a>. It seems the Muslim Council are objecting to the burning of the Bin Laden effigy on Monday night, not a big surprise I suppose but the Lewes Bonfire Societies are known for doing some slighty dodgy effigy burning.</p>
