<p>My folks have been visiting for the last few days, and so we’ve had a bit more opportunity to explore Brighton and Sussex. It’s been great, and the weather has been really kind to us – cold but sunny, and only one day of rain (and we’d planned to be indoors that day anyway – we went around the Pavilion which is a really interesting place). See <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/FothergillVisitNov2001/">the photos</a>.</p>

<p>We also went to a new restaurant on Saturday evening – Lucy’s Restaurant on the sea front, between Alfresco and the new children’s playground. This is a fairly small place, and they’ve just decided to open up in the evenings Thursday to Sunday. The menu isn’t huge, but there is a good choice, and I heartily recommend the lamb cutlets – they were fantastic. It’s a nice relaxed place, and we’ll be going back again soon.</p>
