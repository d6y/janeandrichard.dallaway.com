<p>I had my driving licence sent back to me in the post yesterday. It’s a bit torn but at least that’s one thing less to replace. It was sent in a Royal Mail envelope with a return address of the Surcharge Unit at Gatwick Mail Centre. There was no note or anything inside, so, if someone from the Gatwick Mail Center happens to stumble across this. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>
