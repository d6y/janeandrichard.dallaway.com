<p>I wandered to the bottom of the road this afternoon to see if things were getting back to normal. They weren’t. Police are everywhere and a large area is still closed off. And it’s very quiet. Normally in the day time our road is full of cars parking close to the tube station, and a few buses running up and down the street…but as everyone is being kept away none of that’s been happening.</p>
