<p>My insurance cheques came through yesterday for the items that I lost when my <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/07/had_my_bag_stolen">bag was stolen</a>. Weâ€™re insured by <a href="http://www.nationwide.co.uk/default.htm">Nationwide Building Society</a>, and I think the fact that they turned around my claim in under 2 weeks was really impressive. Well done Nationwide.</p>
