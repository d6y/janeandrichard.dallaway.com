<p>I’ve recently started using <a href="http://calendar.yahoo.com/?v=140&amp;pi=100">Intellisync for yahoo</a> to synchronise my palm to my yahoo calendar, address book and todo list, and so far it’s working really well. It means that when I do a hotsync from my Palm rather than synchonising with the palm desktop, it syncs with the yahoo software making my calendar etc available to me over the internet. What I especially like is the fact that I can choose which applications to sync with yahoo, so at the moment I have the calendar and to do list synchronising all the time that way. The Memos and Addresses I sync with the Palm desktop (at the moment) as they are more likely to be changed from home rather than on the fly. So far everything is going smoothly, and I’ve even got it working from work – so that my Outlook account exports calendar and synchronises task list data to yahoo (I’m only exporting calendar data rather than synching it because I don’t really want everyone at work to know what my social calendar is like…). This means that for finally I have my personal appointments and my work appointments all on the palm, but without having to type the work ones in.</p>

<p>This is of particular use at the moment as I haven’t found a new PDA yet and so am using a PalmPilot Professional. To be honest, PalmOS doesn’t seem to have changed much in the 4 years since this was bought (which is a bit dissapointing) but I find that the grafitti recognition is now too slow to be practical on this old machine. So, being able to update events in my yahoo calendar is a much bigger advantage.</p>
