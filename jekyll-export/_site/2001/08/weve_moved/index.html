<p>At last <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622635106207/">we’ve moved to Brighton</a>. Which is all very lovely, but the question is: do we keep <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/3980750308/">the pelmet</a>? The previous owners left it in the living room. It’s very theatrical (it even has a safety curtain). It’s growing on us. We don’t know if that’s good or bad. You tell us. (Oh, the picture may look a bit odd, because it’s stiched together from four photos).</p>
