<p>I’ve just ordered my first replacement gadget. I’m getting a <a href="http://www.sony.com.sg/consumer/consumer/Radio/srf_m95.html">Sony SRF M95 digital radio</a> to replace the mp3 player. I’ve ordered it from <a href="http://www.simplyradios.com/">Purley Radios Ltd</a>and it should be with me in 5 to 7 working days.</p>

<p>One of the cheques that the insurance company sent was made out to one of the companies that some of the previous gadgets have been bought from. I called them to see if they could order this radio for me, but they said that they didn’t deal with anything other than computer equipment and so they weren’t prepared to order anything in for me. I’m going to call the Nationwide next week to see if they will re-adjust the cheques if I explain the circumstances.</p>
