<p><strong>New toy for Jane</strong></p>

<p>It was my birthday a couple of weeks ago, and I had a nice long think about what I wanted. I decided that, with the hopeful move to Brighton, a portable MP3 player would be a really cool gift. So, we started researching them, and there are SO many to choose from. All with different features, some have radio, some have 64MB, some have 96MB, one has 128MB. I decided that I didn’t want one of the “burn MP3s to CD” versions, as they are quite large (a good idea for the car, but not for lugging around). Some of the other cool ones, mainly due to their size, were the Panasonic e-wear models and the Sony ones. Both of these, however, record the mp3s into their own format. So, despite them coming with a usb connector, it could still take 20 minutes to copy the songs across. I didn’t like the idea of storing songs in yet another format, and so looked around a bit more. </p>

<p>We ended up decided on a <a href="http://www.good.com/frame91c9.html">SoundsGood</a> springboard module that fits into the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/visor.xml">handspring visor</a>. The module itself it small, and fits snugly into the visor springboard port. It has 64MB onboard, uses a USB connector (just the standard cradle) and comes with a desktop application for putting music onto it. It seems to take about 5 minutes to transfer the 64MB across, which I think is pretty reasonable. It also comes with a registered version of musicmatch. We also got the <a href="http://www.good.com/frame080f.html">EnergyClip battery pack</a>. This is the bit that swung it for me really. This takes one AA battery and the module just slips into it. So, you can carry your music around without the visor. You don’t get an LCD display or anything particularly pretty but it’s functional and means that you don’t have to carry the visor with you to listen to music. </p>

<p>Because it only has 64MB, I’m busy converting some of my favourite tracks to a lower bps rate (96) working on the theory that whilst sitting on a tube or train, the loss of sound quality isn’t going to worry me so much. However, I’m looking for a better way to convert them as doing it one album at a time is going to get pretty boring. </p>
