<p>So, we lost 2-1 on aggregate. I wish I could say we were hard done too but, in all honesty I can’t. We played poorly in the first half – we seemed to be playing far too defensively. We looked a lot better in the second half and created a couple of good chances. Orient were the better team but I think they are going to be hard pushed to beat Blackpool in the final at Cardiff.</p>

<p>The atmosphere wasn’t as good as I’d hoped – we were on the terraces and had no roof to help magnify our sound. Shame. I have little voice left so I know I did my bit. The Orient only seemed to have one song “Orient, Orient” – a bit like the Skol lager song. At least we had some variety to offer – including singing “One song, you’ve only got one song”.</p>

<p>It’s dissapointing to lose out but when I think back to how close we were to losing the club completely I don’t feel quite so bad. Next season let’s do it properly and get automatic promotion.</p>

<p>And so, instead of heading for Cardiff on the 26th, it looks like we’ll be on shed building duty – helping Rich’s Dad. Somehow this doesn’t have quite the same appeal.</p>
