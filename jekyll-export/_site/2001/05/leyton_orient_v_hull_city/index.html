<p>Tonight, Hull are playing the 2nd leg of the Play off semi finals at Brisbane Road, London. Hull won the first leg 1-0 so we go into this match with a slight, very slight, advantage. It is the first time Hull have been in the Play Offs and I’m feeling nervous. I’m just waiting to start the journey and it’s a weird feeling. 3000 Hull supporters are expected, and I’m sure we’re going to make some noise and support out team the best we can. We’ve had such a strange season that we’re all really proud of what the team has achieved whatever the result.</p>

<p>Theoretically a live broadcast from the Radio Humberside commentary should be available <a href="http://www.clients.strawberry.co.uk/hullcity/hullcityLIVE.html">here</a>. C’mon you Tigers!</p>
