<p>After a turbulent season, Hull City have made it into the 3rd division play-offs. This eveningâ€™s game at Southend was a draw which was sufficient to ensure we will finish in one of the 4 play-off spots. The official <a href="http://www.hullcityafc.net/vsite/vcontent/content/news/0,10869,999-15217-16469-3815-40507-news-item,00.html">Hull City website</a> states that Brighton will go through as champions, Chesterfield will be promoted despite the recent FA enquiry and so will Cardiff. Hull and Hartlepool are definitely in the play-offs.</p>

<p>So, itâ€™s going to be a nail-biting end to a nail-biting season but at least this time for the right reasons. Of course, weâ€™re almost certain to make it through to the play-off final. Why you ask? Well, Hull City have never been to Wembley. This year is the first that the play-off finals wonâ€™t be at Wembley (whilst itâ€™s being rebuilt), so of course weâ€™ll make it to the final and have to go to the Milennium stadium in Cardiff ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>But, should the play-offs really happen? Is this a fair way to decide the 4th team to be promoted? Should the team who come 4th in the league automatically go up? I donâ€™t know but as I said before, it will make it an exciting end to the season for this Hull supporter.</p>
