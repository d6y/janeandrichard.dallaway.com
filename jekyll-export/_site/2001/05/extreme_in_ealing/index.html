<p>Saturday, Ealing, London: a day out in the park on what must be close</p>

<p>to the hottest day of the year so far. </p>

<p>The excuse: a free extreme day organized by the</p>

<p>local government, where we could try out various extreme sports. It turned out to be dominated by kids, but hey… we invited the New Scientist web team over,</p>

<p>we had fun and discovered that Cathy rules</p>

<p>at shooting because she was taught to shoot at school in France.</p>

<p>The end of the day was spent drinking, chatting, and playing football in</p>

<p>another park, followed by great tapas at <a href="http://www.lammas.com/food/LaSiesta.html">La Siesta</a>. Mmmm… great tapas,</p>

<p>and enough veggie options to keep Ash happy.</p>

<p>As you’d expect, there are <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/eyemodule/extremeealing.html">eyemodule photos</a>.</p>
