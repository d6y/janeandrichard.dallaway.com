<p>I realised today (or I guess more accurately yesterday now) that blogvoices was not running at the moment. We’ve been thinking for a while about creating bulletin boards for other areas of the site, so people can post back about their travels in the countries we’ve been to, or can agree or disagree about our gadget reviews. So, tonight we’ve been adding that functionality. At the moment it only runs from the blog and gadget pages. Soon we hope to get it running off more parts of the site. We’ve used some XML based Perl freeware software – <a href="http://xmlboard.hypermart.net/">XML Board</a>. So, now all the comments are stored on our server, and we’re no longer forced to deal with any delays/unreliabilities of getting to an externally hosted board. We’ve rescued the comments from blogvoices and imported them as a starting point.</p>

<p>Take a look at our <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/cgi-bin/xmlboardsolo.cgi?board=blog&amp;action=index">blog discussions</a> or the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/cgi-bin/xmlboardsolo.cgi?board=gadgets&amp;action=index">gadget discussions</a> boards.</p>
