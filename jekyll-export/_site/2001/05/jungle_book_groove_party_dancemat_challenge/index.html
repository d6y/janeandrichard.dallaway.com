<p>Earlier this year, we bought a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000053W77/richarddallaway/o/qid=990367850/sr=8-2/026-2343603-9869200">Jungle Book Groove Party for the Playstation</a>. This is a fantastic game, you have to dance around on the dance mat in time with the music following the arrows on the screen. Some friends came around for dinner a few months ago, and immediately went out and bought the game themselves. </p>

<p>Yesterday, we had the “Dance Mat Challenge”. The game comes with a few 2 player options, and so we tried them out at their house. One of the options is the head to head match, no big surprises here, both players get to choose a character and then they dance against each other. There was one surprise though, at the point where in the normal game you get a rest, here you get a “Dance Sprint” where you make as many contacts with the mat as you can to score more points. The other game we played was the team game, which was really hard. If one player missed a contact, then the arrow moves over to the other players stack. This was really funny to watch, as the more contacts were missed, the more the boys laughed, and the more they missed.</p>

<p>An excellent game and pretty good exercise too</p>
