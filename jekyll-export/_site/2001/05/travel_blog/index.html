<p>I’ve noticed that in the <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger.com</a> Blogs of Note section recently there have been a couple of travel blogs. These are people who are using blogger to update their web sites during their travels. This is a great idea, and blogger provides a really good interface for this.</p>

<p>Some travel blogs I’ve looked at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://calijourney.blogspot.com/">The Strange California Journey</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.tonyuniverse.com/gregshike/">Greg’s Appalachian Hike</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://volatile.org/travel/">Tina’s Travel’s through New Zealand, Australia, China and Southeast Asia</a></li>
</ul>
