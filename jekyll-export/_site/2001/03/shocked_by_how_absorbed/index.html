<p>I’m shocked by how absorbed I become when playing the card game <a href="http://www.retroactive.com/holiday/pit.html">Pit</a>. You try to collect a set of commodities (like all corn cards, wheat cards, etc) by exchanging them blind with other players. There are no turns, you all just call out how many cards you want to exchange: shouting “trade two two two two TWO TWO” and grab the two cards from anyone who offers. It’s noisy. You need at least three players, but more is better.</p>
