<p>It’s been a turbulent few months for my football club, Hull City. We’ve been in administration since 7th February 2000.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the creditors and the shareholders approved the bid, which means we are just waiting for the FA to approve the deal. The buyers still haven’t revealed who they are yet, apparently we find out more next week, but at least we are still a going concern. And whilst that’s all been happening the team (who haven’t been fully paid since the end of December) have been working really hard to get us to one place off the play-offs. Brian Little, our manager, was awarded <a href="http://www.nationwide.co.uk/football/Common/awards.asp?T_ID=div3&amp;Category=motm">Nationwide Manager of the Month for February (Division 3)</a> and we then proceeded to lose our next game – fairly typical stuff really and it was against Cardiff away – a tough side at the best of times.</p>
