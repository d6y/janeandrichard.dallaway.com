<p>A few minutes ago I was trying to get to my bank in</p>

<p><a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?G2M?X=529648&amp;Y=181214&amp;A=Y&amp;Z=1">Soho Square</a></p>

<p>and I saw the Queen (of England) and Prince Phillip.</p>

<p>There was a crowd of people and lots of police and it looked like someone</p>

<p>was visiting the Tucan pub. Then I spotted the <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/faq/flag.htm">Royal Standard</a> flying on a car, and realized</p>

<p>it was the Queen and she was visiting something opposite the pub.</p>

<p>I was trying to make my way through the crowd and she stepped out</p>

<p>from a building, waved, there was some clapping and cheering, then</p>

<p>she got into a car and was driven away. Show over.</p>
