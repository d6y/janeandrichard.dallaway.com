<p>We spent the weekend in Aberystwyth (Wales, UK). Not sure why really. Hadn’t been there before. Jane might write up a <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/index.html">travelogue</a> but for now we have some”</p>

<p>While researching the trip I found <a href="http://www.virtualhotels.com/">virtualhotels.com</a>, which is handy for narrowing down the choice of hotels in an area. Then you need to jump off to <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> or <a href="http://www.metacrawler.com">similar</a> to get extra information about</p>

<p>a place. </p>

<p>We ended up at <a href="http://www.conrah.co.uk/index.html">Conrah Country House Hotel</a>. Nice place. Great service. Recommended. “Helicopter arrivals may be accommodated by prior arrangement with the hotel”. Of course. We may get addicted to <a href="http://www.johansens.com/stay.html">luxury hotels like the Conrah</a>.</p>
