<p>I spotted <a href="http://www.privacyfoundation.org/privacywatch/report.asp?id=62&amp;action=0">TiVo’s Data Collection and Privacy Practices</a> linked from another blog (<a href="http://boingboing.net">BoingBoing.net</a>) and it makes kind of interesting reading. I’m not sure whether I’m surprised by this or not, I guess I knew Tivo was capable of this as the capturing of viewing data is what makes Tivo work. The paragraph “TiVo permits its subscribers to disable the collection of viewing information and diagnostic logs by calling TiVo toll-free at 1-877-367-8486 (1-877-FOR-TIVO).” is kind of interesting though.</p>

<p>On further investigation, CNN ran a story on the subject yesterday <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/03/26/tv.privacy.ap/index.html">Privacy group criticizes TiVo for collecting info</a></p>
