<p>Material things are just things and don’t matter, or something. But still it’s so good to get our car back again, restored to it’s former glory after a, er, slight miscalculation caused the car to come into contact with a large concrete block when someone, possibly me, was trying to park it. Could have happened to anyone. Anyway…It’s also an excuse to see how images work in blogs.</p>

<p>So this is it, the picture of the back end of our car, all shiny and unscratched. You’ll have to imagine the “before shot”, when this area was dented and mangled.</p>
