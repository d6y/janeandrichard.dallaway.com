<p>So, chaos in London today as the RMT union members strike for better safety on the underground. The <a href="http://www.transportforlondon.gov.uk">Transport for London site</a> has this helpful message “Due to Industrial Action, Tube services throughout London are severley disrupted.” Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.thetube.com/">thetube.com</a> has a more helpful page indicating what services are running.</p>

<p>So, I got a train from Ealing Broadway to Paddington and then walked from there to work at Chancery Lane. It’s about 3 miles and took about an hour. It wasn’t too bad, not something I’d choose to do everyday, but at least it was dry and sunny and not too cold.</p>

<p>It was quite entertaining watching people take to the streets, with cycles, micro scooters, roller blades and on foot. I passed many people with maps in their hands, some looked as if they’d bought A-Z maps especially as the mapbooks looked very clean and new.</p>
