<p>All of the eateries around the office, in Hatton Gardens, are getting worse.</p>

<p>Our favourite cafe was “refurbished” over Christmas and re-opened with new decor and new owners. The food hasn’t been as good since then, so we only go there once a week, rather than every day.</p>

<p>We went to another one today, Aud’s, on Greville Street. The food was okay, but the service was pretty poor. We’d only just finished eating before we were asked to leave as other people were waiting. We weren’t actually intending to sit there all day, but this was just rude (the manner it was said wasn’t pleasant either)</p>

<p>So, we’re on the hunt for a good, reliable cafe, which serves breakfasts and jacket potatoes, and maybe even omelette baps. Any suggestions anyone?</p>
