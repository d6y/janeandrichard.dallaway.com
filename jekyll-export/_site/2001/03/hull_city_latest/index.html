<p>Woohoo! After a draw with Plymouth Argyle last night at Plymouth, Hull are in one of the Play-Off spots. Okay, so we’re 7th and are only one point ahead of Rochdale, and they have 3 games in hand but at least we’re there for the moment.</p>

<p>Our new owner, Adam Pearson, has been speaking to the press and has said that Brian Little will be staying as our manager which is excellent news, and also that he plans to support the project to build a new stadium in Hull. He seems alright for an ex-Leeds Director and Huddersfield Town supporter 😉</p>

<p>And, the chap who used to spend his Saturday Afternoon’s being our mascot, Roary, is mentioned on the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/newsid_1217000/1217824.stm">BBC sport news</a> with his new club, Exeter City.</p>

<p>Plymouth Argyle have banned “Alex the Greek” (which is Roary’s new name/job) from the Plymouth v Exeter match. It would appear that Alex the Greek gets up to all the mischief that he did when he was “Roary the Tiger”, and Plymouth are concerned about him upsetting their supporters. He made the <a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/Observer_Match_Report/0,3740,-21784,00.html">news</a> with the FA Cup match between Hayes Town and Hull City when he was sent off (or at least escorted from the playing area by the stewards).</p>

<p>Exeter approached “Roary” last October and made him an offer he could not refuse. See <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/football/eng%5Fdiv%5F3/newsid%5F990000/990536.stm">Mascot swaps Tigers for leather</a> on the BBC sport news site for more.</p>
