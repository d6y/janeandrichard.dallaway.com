<p>Is <em>Spaced</em> (UK, Channel 4, 21:30) the best thing that has ever been on tv ever? Why yes, yes it is. And is this because it has no canned laughed? Primarily, yes.</p>

<p>One day I’ll get round to picking up the first series on DVD. (Available at <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005957B/richarddallaway/026-9592763-9397260">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://www.blackstar.co.uk/video/item/7000000061464">Blackstar</a> and lots of other places probably.) </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/">semi-official web site</a> is… busy looking. The <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/spaced/tim_daisy.html">official channel 4 one</a> is… less busy looking.</p>
