<p>On my way into work this morning, I took a look at the Metro and a 3 paragraph story caught my eye, the Evening Standard have a version of it <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/dynamic/news/top_story.html?in_review_id=374846&amp;in_review_text_id=320590">‘Scared’ Eubank on scooter charge</a>. Basically, this is the story of how Chris Eubank was charged for riding a <a href="http://www.goped.com/Home.htm">Go-Ped</a> around the streets of Brighton without a helmet. (A Go-Ped is a motorised scooter about which there are very few laws in the UK). What amused me in the Metro article was the following sentence “PC Simon Rideout had to start the blue lights flashing and the siren sounding before the ex-boxer pulled over”. Now, the thought of a police car chasing a Go-Ped is entertaining as Go-Ped’s aren’t exactly the quickest method of transport known to man. Chris Eubank received a conditional discharge and had to pay £35 in costs.</p>

<p>The BBC have a couple of related articles, the first in December 1999 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_568000/568853.stm">Illegal skateboard driver escapes jail</a> which was about someone who was found guilty of riding a motorised skateboard while disqualified from driving, the second in October 2000 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_964000/964591.stm">Police back scooter ban</a> which was about the “issues” with the motorised scooters in regards to the UK law.</p>

<p>One of the shops in Ealing <a href="http://www.ealing-online.com/hippie_heaven.htm">Hippie Heaven</a> has a bigfoot Go-Ped in it’s window, and they really do look cool. (They’re not cheap though :-()</p>
