<p>Every few weeks I seem to get another one of these internet test things, this one kind of appealed <a href="http://www.emode.com/dog/">Emode.com: The All-New What Breed of Dog Are You?</a>. I’m apparently a Bernese Mountain Dog! This means that I’m down-to-earth, strong, and sweet. Awww, nice!</p>

<p>It allows you to add other people to your “pack” and you can see what type of dog all of your friends are, so far I seem to have a mixed set of friends, including some who didn’t like what dog they were the first time and so changed a few answers to become something different</p>
