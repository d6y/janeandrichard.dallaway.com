<p>This is a photo of our technical director, Nick – he claims that his horses always look really happy when eating grass, so he thought he’d try it too. He had his own web site dedicated to his <a href="http://www.horses.co.uk">love of horses</a>, so you can see for yourself all about his current two horses, Bertie and George (George is pictured above).</p>
