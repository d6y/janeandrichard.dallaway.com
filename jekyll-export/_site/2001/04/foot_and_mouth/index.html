<p>Foot and Mouth did have an affect on our weekend but, it was less than during our recent weekend trip to <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/wales.html">Wales</a>. We went to Stonehenge which was partially open (you could walk along the paved area and view the stones – something I’d never done before – but couldn’t get all the around the stones. The rest of the time we were on the coast (which it seems a lot of people chose to do – see <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1280000/1280958.stm">Foot and Mouth did have an affect on our weekend but, it was less than during our recent weekend trip to [Wales](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/wales.html).

The rest of the time we were on the coast (which it seems a lot of people chose to do – see</a> ), and walked from Milford on Sea to Hurst Castle and back again along a small peninsular which was a really great walk. I think it’s fair to say that it didn’t really affect us this trip.</p>

<p>We were listening to reports on the radio on Friday morning about other Countries opinions of how safe England was, it was frightening how misinformed some people are – for instance a US high school teacher who said that “you can touch the rump of a cow with no danger, but if you touch it’s hoof, you’re a gonna”. Other people were stressing about how they wouldn’t want to visit the UK at the moment because it’s so dangerous at the moment. There were some people interviewed who seemed to know what it was all about which was reassuring. There is a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/in_depth/uk/2001/foot_and_mouth/default.stm">full report on the BBC News site</a>.</p>
