<p>It’s always disappointing when you see a different road sign, but then don’t see the thing</p>

<p>you’re being warned against — rock slide, flood, falling rocks… or tank crossing signs like this one, taken someplace around Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p>Still it’s good that we have the signs because if you were driving down a country road and turned a corner to find, without warning, a tank in the middle of the road you’d probably be surprised.</p>
