<p>Have you been got by any good April Fools Day gags today then? So far, I’ve isolated myself away from the outside world and haven’t heard any. When I was little my Dad always used to wake me up on April Fools morning to tell me it had been snowing, without fail, every year until I was around 13 (when it really had been snowing and he couldn’t work out what to say).</p>

<p>The best and most effective one I’ve heard in recent years, was about 5 years ago when April Fools Day fell on a Saturday. <a href="http://www.capitalfm.com">Capital Radio</a> always broadcast a weekday morning show with Chris Tarrant as the DJ. On this Saturday morning, they did a broadcast as if it was Friday, with typical travel reports, talk about weekend plans etc etc. As the morning progressed and Chris admitted it was a joke he got a load of phone calls from people sitting in quiet offices wondering why not many other people were in, it didn’t catch me out but I did have to think twice to realise what was going on. Good one Capital.</p>
