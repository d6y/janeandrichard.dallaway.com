<p>Disaster struck this morning. There I was hot-synching my Handspring visor, when it told me that it’s batteries needed changing. No problem I thought and got some nice new duracells for it. I took the old batteries out (some Nimh rechargables) and put the new Duracell Ultras in. As usual, this was done in the minimum amount of time possible to ensure that it didn’t reset. So, having put the new batteries in, I turned the visor on. No response. The screen just stayed blank and there was no power. Aaaggghhh. So, my next thing was to find another set of batteries and try those. Still no response. Eek! Panic! Panic! I decided to press the reset button to see if that made any difference, there was now life and I got the Palm OS screen over and over and over again. The last chance was to take the batteries out altogether and let it “chill” for a while. This worked. The visor was okay again. Odd, very odd. I reinstalled all the stuff and it now seems to be ok.</p>

<p>After a little bit of investigation on the web, it would appear that you need to tell your visor that you’re using Nimh batteries (which I hadn’t – oops!). I’m planning on downloading one of the apps like <a href="http://www.palmgear.com/software/showsoftware.cfm?sid=98876220010410054918&amp;prodID=4822">Battery Meter Hack from PalmGear</a> as this allows you to specify the type of batteries you’re using.</p>
