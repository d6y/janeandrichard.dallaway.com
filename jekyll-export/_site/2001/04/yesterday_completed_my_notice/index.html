<p>Yesterday I completed my notice period and left my job at <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/">New Scientist</a>. I’ve been working with them since the site launched on 5 October 1995. So, it’s going to be odd, but I needed to find something else to do and move out of London. Not sure what that will be. Hopefully I won’t miss the people, because I’m going to try to stay in touch 🙂</p>

<p>Thanks for the send off guys! And the geek toys! There are <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/eyemodule/ns.html">more photos</a>.</p>
