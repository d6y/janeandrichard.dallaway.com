<p>”</p>

<p>We watched “Romeo and Juliet” (the 1996 one starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes) on DVD last night. I must admit to being dissapointed with it. It got better as it went on (in my opinion) but it took me a long time to get used to the setting – having a gun fight at a petrol station whilst speaking lines such as “Do you bite your thumb at me?” just seemed odd to me. I enjoy Shakespeare and normally the setting doesn’t bother me, but this just didn’t work for me I’m afraid. Pete Postlethwaite played the part of Friar Lawrence very well, and he made the film worth watching. My opinion seems to be very different than those expressed at the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004D31K/richarddallaway">Amazon.co.uk</a> review of the film, but that’s what opinions are all about :-).</p>
