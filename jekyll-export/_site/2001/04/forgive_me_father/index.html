<p>Forgive me father… it has been 11 days since I last blogged. One of the things that’s been keeping me busy is the time spent on cleaning up some old photographs.</p>

<p>The first picture (above) is the original that I’m working on, and to the right are the “before” and “after” shots showing some of the detail. It’s sloooooooow work, and there’s much to do.</p>

<p>The picture, BTW, is of me and my sister, taken sometimes in the ’70s I guess. The next one to start work on, should I ever finish this one, is of my mum from the 1950s….</p>
