<p>We found this picture yesterday in the art centre of <a href="http://www.guidetorichmond.co.uk/syon.html">Syon House</a> and Richard bought it and a frame for me as part of my birthday present. I hadn’t seen any of Jack Vettriano’s work before, and this picture really appealed to me. I was surprised to find out he is Scottish, as this picture really makes me think of the USA, probably because I associate the style of dress with gangsters. “The Billy Boys” is on display at <a href="http://www.portlandgallery.com/">Portland Gallery</a> in London, and I feel that I may need to go and see the picture in the flesh (so to speak).</p>
