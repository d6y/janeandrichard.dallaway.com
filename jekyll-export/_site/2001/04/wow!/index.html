<p>Wow! One of our web servers needed rebooting at the hosting place we use, and people had been trying to get out of doing it all afternoon, it’s normally such a hassle to go over there and do it. Then Jon (one of our Director’s) said we could take his car. So, we did. We took his Lotus 340r out for a spin to the hosting site, Tricky got to drive it, and I got to be the passenger saying “Wow” a lot. Cool car, really cool, impractical for London (no roof, no doors – those kind of things) but definitely well cool. He bought it around this time last year, and guess what, he has a <a href="http://www.lotus340r.co.uk">website</a> dedicated to it. There were 340 of them made, and his is number 157. Wow!</p>
