<p>I’ve just finished reading an e-book, one of only two that money has been spent on. I’ve read quite a few classics from <a href="http://www.memoware.com">memoware.com</a> (available free of charge). The first book I read which was only digitally released was “Jagged Greenstone” by Loren Teague (get it <a href="http://www.pdabookstore.com/cgi-bin/bookstore.cgi?Any=jagged">here</a>). Whilst the story, from what I recall, was possibly a little weak, I found the experience of reading it on the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/visor.xml">visor</a> a pleasant one.</p>

<p>The book I’ve just finished,</p>

<p>“Presumption of Guilt” by Jay Abramson, was not such a good experience. I like the whole e-publishing idea. I think it’s a good way to get published, and a good way to test the waters with a story. However, I do not think that it is an excuse for poor spelling, poor grammar and missing words. “Presumption of Guilt” is littered with them. This distracted from the whole experience for me, and I feel that the $6 that my friend paid to buy this book for me could have been better spent.</p>

<p>I am not going to let this unpleasant experience stop me from reading more books in this way. But, I might be more careful in how I choose them. (<a href="http://www.pdabookstore.com">Pdabookstore.com</a> allow you, in most cases, to download a free excerpt, normally a chapter or so). I don’t think digital publishing should do away with the quality elelment. If money is being paid for an e-book, then I want it to be of the same quality as if I was paying for printed media. The odd mistake is understandable, even bestsellers have those, but the amount of errors in this indicated that it had never even been proof-read.</p>

<p>Ironically, “Presumption of Guilt” is actually a pretty good story, lots of twists and turns, possibly a little bit slow in places but overall pretty good. It’s a shame that I don’t feel that I could ever recommend it because of the grammar and spelling errors.</p>

<p>My grammar may not be perfect, but I’m not charging you $6 to read this 🙂</p>
