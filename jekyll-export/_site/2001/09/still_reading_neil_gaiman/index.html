<p>I’m still reading <a href="http://www.americangods.com/journal/journal.asp">Neil Gaiman’s blog</a> every day and on Tuesday he talked about Fay Weldon and her new book “The Bulgari Connection” which is sponsored by Bulgari, and contains “product placements” (the first time this has been done in a novel apparently). Neil comments on it, giving a bit of a background on it before going on to say:</p>

<p><em>Personally, I think it’s a triffic idea, and would like to announce that any manufacturers of fine fountain pens who want to get plugged in the text of the next novel should just drop me a line. And a sample fountain pen or two. Also people selling small south sea islands — I will happily plug your south sea island sales company in my next novel in exchange for a small island of my own.</em></p>

<p>Well, it made me chuckle anyway.</p>
