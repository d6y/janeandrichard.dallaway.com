<p>I’ve just been out and bought a new gadget. I’m replacing my stolen Visor Deluxe with a <a href="http://www.handera.com/products/330.asp">Handera 330</a>. The Handera has a lot of improvements over the Visor Deluxe, in the form of a higher resolution screen, a software grafitti area, a jog dial, a microphone which works (the Visor has one that does nothing). I’m sure to be spending the next couple of days playing with it, and adding lots of programs to it.</p>
