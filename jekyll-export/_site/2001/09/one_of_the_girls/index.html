<p>One of the girls in our office had a really bad attack of the hiccups this afternoon, so much so that all of the office resorted to trying to find a way to make her stop. The usual suggestions were made “Hold your breath”, “Drink water slowly” etc. but the one that worked was a new one on me. Julia walked up to her with a ten pound note in her hand and said “I’ll give you this if you hiccup again”. She didn’t. It was quite amazing really.</p>
