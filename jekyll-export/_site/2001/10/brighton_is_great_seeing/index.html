<p>Brighton is great. Seeing as how we’ve finally got the decorating sorted (well most of it anyways) we can now spend more time exploring our new surroundings. At the weekend we had some great walks along the sea front. We went up to <a href="http://www.hovelagoon.co.uk/">Hove Lagoon</a> and watched some of the people sailing and windsurfing. This got us thinking about giving the sailing thing a try one day. Unfortunately there wasn’t much of a breeze so we didn’t get to take the kite out this weekend, but I have now got a Membership form for the <a href="http://www.brightonkiteflyers.co.uk/">Brighton Kite Flyers</a> so hopefully soon we’ll get some good information about where to go when there doesn’t seem to be much wind about.</p>
