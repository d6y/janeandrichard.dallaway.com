<p>Yesterday we made the trip up to the <a href="http://www.virgin.net/music/guide/venue.jsp?venueId=1492">Hammersmith Apollo</a> to see <a href="http://eden.vmg.co.uk/davidsylvian/">David Sylvian</a> play. It was a good show but I think “Dave” was pushing his luck waiting so long before coming back on for an encore. I think the stage manager was probably telling him to get back out because he had another 20 minutes to do, or something. Luckily there were enough fanatics in the audience willing to clap and clap and clap until he did come out (the guy who shouted “we love you Sylvian” probably shouldn’t be let out alone again…). Oh, the keyboard player was <a href="http://www.muppets.com/profiles/rowlf.htm">Rowlf</a> from the Muppets. I’m sure of it.</p>
