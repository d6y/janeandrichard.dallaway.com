<p>On Friday we were eating at <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/international/tureen.html">Barryâ€™s At The Tureen</a>. As well as having great service and great food, Barry turned out to know our next door neighbours, gave us a phone number of someone near by who could help track down some of the history of our house, and for good measure, told us about the <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/archive/2001/07/05/NEWS300ZM.html">murder that took place in our street this year</a>.</p>
