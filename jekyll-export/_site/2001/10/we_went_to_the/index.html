<p>We went to the football on Saturday afternoon at Boothferry Park, Hull to see the Hull City vs Halifax game. It’s about 8 months since we were last at Boothferry Park for a game and it was really good to see the place so full – approximately 9,500 people. It was a typical 3rd division game really, not much elegance but quite a good game none the less. Helped, no doubt, by the fact we won 3 – 0.</p>
