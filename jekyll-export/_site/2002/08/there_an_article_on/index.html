<p>There’s an <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/dynamic/news/top_story.html?in_review_id=680046&amp;in_review_text_id=652463">article</a> on the <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk">ThisisLondon.co.uk</a> site about the temperatures on the London Underground during summer – it’s hotter than the EU regulations for transporting animals, but there are no regulations for transporting people apparently!. Glad I don’t have to use the tube any more.</p>
