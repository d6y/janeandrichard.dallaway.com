<p>I’ve been <a href="http://redherring.com/insider/2002/0719/playstation071902.html">reading up on the Playstation 3</a> and in particular how it’s going to be able to call up extra computing power to do…well… whatever it needs to do to make games better.</p>

<p>Some people think this “grid computing” is best for <a href="http://www.catchoday.com/archives/362.html">big business and academia</a>, and some people think it’ll let us run <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2141200.stm">weather forecasts for our own back gardens</a>, but I like the idea for games. But still… I’ll believe it when the PS3 ships. I can see how it would help simulations, but I can’t see how it’d work to speed up graphics.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s just an intro to my current fave on-line cartoon. Before I give you the link, you need to know something about the cartoon Voltron by reading up on [</p>

<p>one of the characters](http://looneytunys.com/allura.html) and you also need to know that <a href="http://iocon.com/cj/tf/techspecs/devastat.htm">Devastator</a> is a Transformer that’s a “bizarre combination of six Constructicons: Scrapper, Scavenger, Bonecrusher, Hook, Long Haul, and Mixmaster”. Ok, here’s the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2002-08-08">cartoon</a>.</p>
