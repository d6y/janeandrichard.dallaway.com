<p>A few months ago I received an email from someone asking if they could see a higher res image of <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/bonfire_2001/img_0854_640/">this photo</a> to see if they wanted to use it in their magazine. I replied and thought no more about it until today when I got an email saying that it is going to be in the November issue. I haven’t asked for any money, just a credit and a copy of the <a href="http://www.saveur.com/">magazine</a> when it’s published.</p>
