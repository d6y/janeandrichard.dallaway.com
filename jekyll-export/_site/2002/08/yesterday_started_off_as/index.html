<p>Yesterday started off as a nice sunny day, so Rich and I decided to go down to <a href="http://www.itchybrighton.co.uk/venues/369.html">Bar Gemini</a> to meet Jeremy and Kirsty for a beer and then some lunch. We’d had a couple, and the band had finally started to play when it started to rain, and it really rained. People were streaming from the beach to the nearest shelter, people were packed into the pubs and shops along the sea front. And the rain continued. We watched one lady walk past with a carrier bag on her head. Then her and her friend found a big puddle and started kicking water at each other – the boys hoped it was going to become a wrestling match but they moved on. To be honest we really had a good laugh, and I took a few <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622636785083/">photos</a> to record the event.</p>

<p>When the rain calmed down, we made a run for it and went for our delayed lunch at <a href="http://www.sixcretail.com/browns.htm">Browns</a> and slowly dried out.</p>
