<p>We live at the end of a <a href="http://www.roads.dft.gov.uk/roadsafety/hc/sign164.shtml">no through road</a>. Every day someone will walk up the street, get to the end, sigh, and walk back down again. It’s an easy mistake to make, because all the other roads that run parallel to ours do have an exit.</p>

<p>So I guess it’s no surprise that at 2am on Wednesday a panic-stricken man came running up the street, hoping to escape the people who were chasing him. We can only imagine what went through his mind when he realized there was no exit from the street…</p>

<p>His pursuers caught up with him, and proceeded to smash his head against our car and other cars parked at the end of the road. This was all witnessed by our next-door neighbour. I slept right thought it, but Jane says she woke to hear some screaming.</p>

<p>They ran off, probably when they heard the police sirens.</p>
