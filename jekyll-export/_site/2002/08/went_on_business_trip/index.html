<p>I went on a business trip to the East End of London the other day, and as we were joining the A2 (I think) down a slip road a guy went hooning past us to get on the road before us. To do this he drove over the pavement slamming the car down the kerb. He passed us okay, but much to our amusement heâ€™d punctured one of his tyres and so had to pull off the road where it appeared he discovered that he had no spare. I admit it, we chuckled at his misfortune.</p>
