<p>I had possibly the most impressive buying-to-delivery online shopping experience the other day. On Wednesday evening I ordered something from <a href="http://www.thingstoengrave.co.uk">Things to Engrave</a>. It was a silverplated item which was to be engraved with a message. This morning, Friday, it arrived. So, that’s under one business day to turn it around. I’m really impressed by that.</p>
