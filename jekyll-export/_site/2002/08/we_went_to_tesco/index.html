<p>We went to <a href="http://www.tesco.com/">Tesco</a>‘s this evening to do some grocery shopping, and whilst we were picking up some fruit juice I noticed some Disney fruit drink labelled “<a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/story.jsp?story=307981">Roo Juice</a>” with a picture of <a href="http://members.aol.com/purrfctkty/kangaandroo.html">Kanga and Roo</a> on the front. Poor little roo… Good job they didn’t name it after Winnie the Pooh though isn’t it 🙂</p>
