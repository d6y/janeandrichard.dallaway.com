<p>Well, I sat and watched the Women’s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/winterolympics2002/hi/english/static/winter_olympics/event_guide/curling.stm">Curling</a> final in the Winter Olympics. I still aren’t sure of the rules, or the strategy and tactics of the game, but by the time it got to 3 – 3 and it was the final end of the match, I was really sitting up and taking notice. For a sport that I’ve never really tried to watch before, it got me pretty hooked – admittedly I wouldn’t have been watching it if it was a British (ok, ok, Scottish) team in the final. But, they won and that was the first Gold medal that Britain has won in a Winter Olympics in 18 years. And, combined with the Bronze medal for Alex Coomber in the Skeleton Bob, this makes these Winter Olympics the best for Britain since 1936!!!</p>

<p>Well Done Team Great Britain.</p>
