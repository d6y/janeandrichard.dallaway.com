<p>Yesterday was <a href="http://www.historychannel.com/exhibits/valentine/">Valentine’s Day</a>, so we treated ourselves to a meal from <a href="http://www.leapingsalmon.com/">leapingsalmon.com</a>. This is the “gourmet meal kit” service: you pick the meal you want, and they send you all the ingredients… all of them including little tiny bottles of olive oil, little tubs of sugar — the only ingredient we had to add ourselves was water.</p>

<p>Of course you can buy the ingredients and make a nice meal without help from Leaping Salmon, but it’s a nice treat to have everything delivered in one package for you to prepare. Believe me, we don’t usual start a mid-week meal with <a href="http://www.leapingsalmon.com/productsinfo.asp?Scr=1&amp;MPos=11&amp;PR_ID=125&amp;mscssid=&amp;meal_type=3&amp;BusID=&amp;RefLink=">tatin of cherry tomatoes</a> (mmm… yummy). We also had the <a href="http://www.leapingsalmon.com/productsinfo.asp?Scr=1&amp;MPos=3&amp;PR_ID=056&amp;mscssid=&amp;meal_type=1&amp;BusID=&amp;RefLink=">roast salmon with nori and pine nut crust</a>. All very tasty, easy and quick to make.</p>

<p>It even ended up looking like it was supposed to look (more or less):</p>

<p>The only downside is… what to do with all the packaging.</p>
