<p>I didn’t get to see much of the Olympics over the weekend as we were in Hull (see the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedlog/archive/2002_02_01_index.xml#10076168">wedlog</a>). But, I was really pleased when Dad told me that Britain (okay, Scotland again) had won another medal – this time a bronze for ski-ing. Apparently this is the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/winterolympics2002/hi/english/alpine_skiing/newsid_1838000/1838032.stm">first British medal on snow</a>. Fantastic stuff. This must make these the most successful Olympics for Britain ever!!!</p>
