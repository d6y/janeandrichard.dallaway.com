<p>Okay, not exactly, but I noticed from a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1803000/1803715.stm">story</a> on the BBC that the Queen has released a <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page920.asp">message</a> to celebrate the 50th anniversary of her Accession to the throne – on the Royal Family’s website. Do you think she’s going to start blogging?</p>
