<p><a href="http://www.eurosport.com/home/pages/L2/S82/stories_Lng2_Spo82.shtml">British Eurosport</a> are providing some great coverage of the Olympic games. I’m normally a BBC girl for sport, but they seem to be limited to showing mainly round-up programmes whereas British Eurosport are showing full events (although the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/winterolympics2002/hi/english/bbc_coverage/newsid_1766000/1766706.stm">BBC weekend schedule</a> looks better). Unfortunately, I seem to have mainly seen lots of cross country ski-ing and definitely haven’t seen enough luge yet.</p>
