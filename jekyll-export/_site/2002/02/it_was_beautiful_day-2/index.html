<p>It was a beautiful day here in Brighton yesterday, and so the intrepid cyclists (that’s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4085061691/in/set-72157622759196824/">Paul</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4085805278/in/set-72157622634946179/">Rich</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4085871458/in/set-72157622759318274/">I</a>) went off for a new adventure. We did our first full route from the <a href="http://www.ctc.org.uk">CTC</a>‘s Trails by Rails collection. We headed off to Falmer by train, and then cycled along some lovely tracks.</p>

<p>The route was supposed to take 1 – 1.5 hours, but we think that the people who measured the tracks were a) fitter than us and b) cycling on less muddy and rutted tracks – in some places it was impossible to cycle as we couldn’t turn our pedals around without hitting the banks of the ruts. It ended up taking us 4 hours to do the trail, although according to Paul’s computer we were only actually cycling for 2 hours of that – we must have had lots of rest time.</p>

<p>We joined the South Downs Way part way through the trail, and got to watch some hang-gliders, paragliders and even a proper glider. As we cycled closer to the Ditchling Beacon car park there were more and more people walking along – I wonder how busy this will be during the summer months! All in all a really good ride, and one that I’m sure we’ll do again. See the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622759196824/">photos</a>.</p>
