<p>We were in Hull at the weekend (see the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedlog/archive/2002_07_01_index.xml#78659573">wedlog</a>) and were doing some shopping at <a href="http://www.princes-quay.co.uk/">Princes Quay</a>. We noticed a lot of canoeists in the water that surrounds the shopping centre, and it turned out to be the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/hull_canoepolo/">Hull International Canoe Polo competition</a>. Now we’d never seen Canoe Polo before, and the first game we watched was a ladies game and it was really interesting. Later in the afternoon, after we’d finished shopping, we stopped and watch a couple of the mens games, and were amazed at how aggressive, fast and enjoyable to watch they were. The Hull event seems to be an annual event, so hopefully we’ll remember to keep an eye out for it next year and go and watch some more games.</p>
