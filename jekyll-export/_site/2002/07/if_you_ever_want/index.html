<p>If you ever want to guarantee good weather for an event or other, then just check and see if we’re likely to be driving to Hull or anywhere else involving lots of motorways. We always seem to be sitting in stationery traffic on the hottest days of the year. </p>

<p>Our journey on Friday was horrid. Because there had been a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2152970.stm">tanker overturned on the Surrey section of the M25</a> we decided to try a different route and headed off via Dartford, M11, A14, A1 and then on the usual route. THe M25 was busy, then the M11 had roadworks and there was a broken down car on the A14 (causing tailbacks of 12 miles or so). It took us 7 hours to get from Brighton to Hull and we were both heartily fed up by the time we got there.</p>

<p>In total contrast, we left Hull a little earlier than usual today and managed the journey back to Brighton in 4.5 hours – the roads were great. Because it was such a hot day we figure lots of people had decided to stay wherever they were for a little longer, meaning we had a smooth run. Hurrah!</p>
