<p>A while ago I spotted a new book by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/figlover/figlover.shtml">Fi Glover</a> in a “2 for £10” offer at a book stop. Given that I liked her <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/books/reviews/rich/oiltanker.xml">previous book</a> (and <a href="/books/reviews/jane/oiltanker.xml">so did</a> Jane), I figured this would be more of the same and bought it.</p>

<p>”</p>

<p>Last week, I was about to begin a two-and-a-half hour train journey across Ireland. I opened the book and thought “Hmm… this looks familiar”. Turns out the publishers had slapped on some new cover art and changed the title from “I am an oil tanker” to “Travels with my radio”. Other than that, it’s exactly the same book. Bah. </p>

<p>So, when it comes to impulse purchases in book shops, just say no. And when embarking on a long train journey across Ireland, make sure you have a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864503793/richarddallaway">back up book</a>.</p>
