<p>It’s a beautiful hot and sunny day here in Brighton, and I’m suffering. Our office has no air conditioning, so we have the windows open and the fan blowing but it’s not really cooling me down. Normally, we’re really casual here, and so in normal circumstances I’d have been sitting here in t-shirt and shorts. Unfortunately today we’re all “suited and booted” for a meeting in London this afternoon, of all the days we have to be smart. Still at least the car has air conditioning so the journey won’t be so bad…</p>
