<p>What a pleasant evening. It’s Jeremy’s birthday today so we’ve just been to the Three Jolly Butchers for a couple of pints with the birthday boy. It’s a really nice pub, and is in danger of becoming our “local” – fairly quiet, serves good beer, not too busy (sounds like we’re getting old doesn’t it??? – ho hum).</p>

<p>For Jeremy’s birthday we bought him the <a href="http://www.thediscoverystore.co.uk/index.asp?product=30925">Executive Air Hockey Game</a> from the <a href="http://www.thediscoverystore.co.uk">Discovery store</a>. Somehow, I think this will be arriving in the office tomorrow, actually, make that I <strong><em>hope</em></strong> this will be arriving in the office tomorrow :-D. Apologies to anyone in the Three Jolly Butchers this evening who wondered what the hell the noise was – that was us. Sorry!</p>
