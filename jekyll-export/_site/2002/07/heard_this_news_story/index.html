<p>I heard this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2151754.stm">news story</a> on the radio this morning. Apparently, Burger King, MacDonalds, Wendys and KFC are being sued by a group of obese americans. This could be an interesting case to keep an eye on. If they suceed then will the Fast Food Outlets have to go the way of the cigarette companies and have “Caution: This product may lead to obesity, heart disease and diabetes.” warnings all over them?</p>
