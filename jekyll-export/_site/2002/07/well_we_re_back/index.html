<p>Well, we’re back in Brighton now after an action packed week in Ireland. I haven’t had time to process the (many) photos yet, or write up the journal but it’ll happen sometime soon (ish!). We were on a cycling trip with <a href="http://www.cyclingsafaris.com/">Irish Cycling Safaris</a> and we had a great time – the people on the trip were really good fun and we all got along really well. We did the <a href="http://www.cyclingsafaris.com/tours/safaris/connemara.html">Connemara, Galway and Mayo</a> tour, and some of the scenery was beautiful. We were very lucky with the weather as we only had showers on 2 days, which is a bit of a miracle for the summer in Ireland this year which is shaping up to be <a href="http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/ireland/2002/0713/2630826566HM3WEATHER.html">the worst for many years</a>.</p>
