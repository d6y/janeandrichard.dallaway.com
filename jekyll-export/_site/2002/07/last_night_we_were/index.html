<p>Last night we were at <a href="http://www.ecademy.com/">ecademy</a> in London to hear a talk by Jason Porter, one of the founders of <a href="http://www.friendsreunited.co.uk">Friends reunited</a>. He gave us <a href="http://www.friendsreunited.co.uk/FriendsReunited.ASP?WCI=Info">the history</a>, and a few facts: 10,000 people joining the site <em>per day</em>; they built the site in a couple of weeks (“and it shows”, heckled <a href="http://www.hodgkinson.org">Dave</a>). But nothing really interesting. It would have been a wasted day if we hadn’t also been in town to meet up with some friends.</p>
