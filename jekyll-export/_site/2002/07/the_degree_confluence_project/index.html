<p>The <a href="http://www.confluence.org/">Degree Confluence Project</a> is interesting: “The goal of the project is to visit each of the latitude and longitude integer degree intersections in the world, and to take pictures at each location”. There are 12,629 still to do, but France is now “done”.</p>
