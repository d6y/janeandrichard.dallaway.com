<p>Hmm, weird. The socks I’m wearing today seem to have a slightly velcro like property to them. Or at least they stick ever so slightly to the carpet in the office (yes, I spend most of my day wandering around in my socks). Very strange. Haven’t noticed it before, but then these don’t get worn very often – they’re kind of an emergency pair.</p>
