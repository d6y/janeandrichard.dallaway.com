<p>So, a guy has just beaten the world record for visiting all the stations on the London Underground in the shortest amount of time – more <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/dynamic/news/top_story.html?in_review_id=649093&amp;in_review_text_id=620113">here</a>. The guy is from Nottingham and says it’s been an ambition since he was a child and first went on a tube. It’s quite obvious he doesn’t live or work in London though, it’s normally enough of a hassle just taking the tubes you need to get to work, never mind trying to visit all the stations on the network. It says he beat the previous best by 40 minutes, but is any allowance made for the new stations that are added? Like the Jubilee line extension when that opened a couple of years ago? Is this particular record getting harder to beat every time a new station is added?</p>
