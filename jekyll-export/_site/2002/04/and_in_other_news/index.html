<p>And in other news, the <a href="http://www.centerparcs.com/">Center Parcs</a> complex that we are meant to be going to for a long weekend in June has been on fire today. It sounds quite serious. From the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/england/newsid_1910000/1910618.stm">BBC report</a></p>

<p><em>Graham Smith, assistant chief fire officer for Suffolk, said: “It’s a particularly difficult fire to tackle due to the early collapse of some of the structure which has created dangerous conditions for the firefighters.”</em></p>

<p>Not sure I like the “early collapse of some of the structure” bit at all…</p>
