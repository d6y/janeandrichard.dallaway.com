<p>So, on Easter Sunday, a group of tall Elvises took to the streets of Brighton. Yesterday I put the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622759197854/">photos up</a> and this has led to a discussion of what the plural of Elvis is. Suggestions so far are Elvii, Elvises, Elveses and Elvis impersonators. Now I think the last one is a bit of a cheat and an avoidance of the real problemâ€¦ Any suggestions?</p>
