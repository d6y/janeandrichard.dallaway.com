<p>It’s strange, we hadn’t been to the cinema in ages, and have been twice this week. We went to see Ice Age on Sunday with Susie, and then to see Bend It Like Beckham last night.</p>

<p><a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/Film_Page/0,4061,663590,00.html">Ice Age</a> is pretty amusing, an animated tale about a group of animals who are trying to return a baby to its “herd” (yes, a little bit Jungle Book). There are some really amusing bits, and it isn’t just for children.</p>

<p><a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/Film_Page/0,4061,681502,00.html">Bend It Like Beckham</a> is a great film, about two 18 year old girls who are both football mad. One is an asian girl who wants to play football like Beckham despite her families protests and their expectations for her. The other is a white girl whose Mother just wants her to be a “normal girl”, and not spend all her time practising football.</p>
