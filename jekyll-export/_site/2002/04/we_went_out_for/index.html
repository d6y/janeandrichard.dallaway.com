<p>We went out for some beers last night, and didn’t get around to eating anything until 10.30. By this time our favourite fish and chip shop had closed. So, we decided to try Uncle Sams burger place. I should have read the description on the board better, but I didn’t and so was a bit surprised when I got home to discover that my Veggie Samwich was a bread cake, 2 slices of cheese and some salad – and that was all, nothing burger shaped. I won’t be ordering that again :-(.</p>
