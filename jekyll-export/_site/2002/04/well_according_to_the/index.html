<p>Well, according to the <a href="http://www.hullcityafc.net">official web site</a> Hull City have got a new manager. Brian Little left quite some time ago, and now <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/football/teams/h/hull_city/newsid_1910000/1910587.stm">Jan Molby</a> has joined us (after resigning from Kidderminster Harriers a few days ago). He had been rumoured to be joining us for at least the last two weeks. Still, at least it has been resolved.</p>
