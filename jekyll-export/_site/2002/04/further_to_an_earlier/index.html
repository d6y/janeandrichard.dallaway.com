<p>Further to <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/04/and_in_other_news">an earlier blog</a> about the fire at Center Parcs, a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/england/newsid_1932000/1932682.stm">BBC news report</a> is saying that the Suffolk Fire Service have released a report which says that contractors working on a roof caused the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/england/newsid_1911000/1911258.stm">fire</a> to start, and that it spread too quickly for Center Parcs own Firefighters to deal with it.</p>

<p>Still haven’t heard anything about our weekend in June yet, but seeing as how the BBC report says “Rebuilding work at the centre is likely to take several months to complete” I’m not hopeful about it.</p>
