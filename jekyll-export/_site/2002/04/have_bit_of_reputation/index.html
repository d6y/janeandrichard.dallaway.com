<p>I have a bit of a reputation in our office as being the <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> Queen. Whenever anyone wants to know the answer to some unusual question, I crank up google and mostly find the answer. Because of this, I was asked to find the submission urls for various search engines so we could publicise our new <a href="http://www.fluidnetwork.com">website</a>. I found the submission forms on the big sites, and a few Free submission sites who submit your site to lots of search engines for you for free (we’re not interested in paying for submission at the moment, although we may go down that route later). One such site is <a href="http://www.submitcorner.com/">Submit Corner</a> who seem to have a lot of search engines listed. I’ve given them a try and we’ll see how we get on.</p>
