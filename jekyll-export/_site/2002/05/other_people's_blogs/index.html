<p>For one reason or another I’ve read a few other people’s blogs recently, and I thought it was only fair to give them a mention. </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://bostonblueyes.blogspot.com/">BostonBlueEyes</a> tells about the exploits of Colin and the lovely D. It’s well written and quite interesting, and he was kind enough to publish a blog entry especially for us the other week.</li>
  <li>I followed a link from BostonBlueEyes to <a href="http://www.amethyst85.blogspot.com/">Amethyst</a> and found it quite interesting reading about Karen’s trip to the UK. Sounds like she had a great time.</li>
  <li>As mentioned before [<a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/06/neil_gaiman_co_author">1</a>][<a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/09/still_reading_neil_gaiman">2</a>][<a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/10/read_neil_gaiman_site">3</a>], I still read <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/journal.asp">Neil Gaiman</a>‘s blog. I still find him amusing, and Richard bought me the book “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747263744/richarddallaway">American Gods</a>” for my birthday so I’m looking forward to reading that – the last Neil Gaiman book I read was “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552137030/richarddallaway">Good Omens</a>” – a joint effort between Neil and Terry Pratchett.</li>
  <li>I stumbled across <a href="http://michele.digikym.com/">Winter Wonderland</a> when I searched google for wedding related blogs and check back every now and again to see what they’re up to. They get married very soon indeed so Good Luck Michele and Allen.</li>
  <li>I used to read a GadgetGirl blog, by <a href="http://suey.org.uk">Suey</a> but she seems to have fallen off the edge of the internet.</li>
  <li>And not forgetting <a href="http://www.spunkythemonkey.co.uk/brainspew.asp">SpunkyTheMonkey</a> and the infrequently updated <a href="http://jocke.selincite.com/currently.php">Jocke</a> – both of whom I used to work with at <a href="http://www.aspectgroup.co.uk">Aspect</a>, and of course <a href="http://www.daisyevans.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/diary1.html">Daisy</a> whose Mummy I worked with there as well.</li>
</ul>
