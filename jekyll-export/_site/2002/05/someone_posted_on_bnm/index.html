<p>Someone posted on <a href="http://www.brightonnewmedia.org">BNM</a> this morning about the new O’Reilly book “Essential Blogging”. This is due for release in August, but is currently available for <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1440">technical review in PDF form</a>. It’s aimed an novice bloggers and people who don’t have a blog at the moment and want one, and reviews the different options. I’ve had a read of the first chapter, and it seems to be pretty well written, and very readable.</p>
