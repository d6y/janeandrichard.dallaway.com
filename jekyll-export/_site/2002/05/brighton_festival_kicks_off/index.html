<p><a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/festival/">Brighton Festival</a> kicks off about… now. So many things on, but we’ve only just started to get tickets. That’s because the <a href="http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/">festival web site</a> is horrid. It’s not just the usability of the site and the missing features (let me get this straight: I <em>can’t</em> book on-line? Hellllooo?), but it’s that it doesn’t have all the information that the printed guide has. So we waited until the printed guide came out, and we’re using that. Shame.</p>
