<p>I know we go on a lot about <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml">TiVo</a>, but this impressed me…</p>

<p>We’d notice a problem where TiVo had confused a bunch of channels: what it thought</p>

<p>was BBC4 (say) was actually something like the Parliament channel. This is bad, because when TiVo spots</p>

<p>something good to record, it changes to the wrong channel and records something else. Bah. </p>

<p>On Monday I put a call into TiVO to see what was happening, and they said they’d look into and probably</p>

<p>update our TiVo.</p>

<p>Today, they call back.</p>

<p>The problem, they’d figured out, was actually with our set-top box. TiVo was right, the set-top</p>

<p>box had the channels confused. Now, I’d have expected most companies to say “we’re right, it’s</p>

<p>somebody else’s problem, give them (your now out-of-business set-top box manufacturer) a call”, but the TiVo folk knew what set-top box we have, and gave me the</p>

<p>detailed instructions on what to do to fix it.</p>

<p>TiVo: expensive, but in the end, good value.</p>
