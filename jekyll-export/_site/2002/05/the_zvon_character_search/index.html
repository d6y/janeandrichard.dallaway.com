<p>The <a href="http://www.zvon.org/other/charSearch/PHP/search.php">Zvon Character Search</a> is one of those really useful geek sites that I can never remember the name of, or the address of. Okay, so itâ€™s not going to be of interest to many people, but if you ever code xml it might just be of use as it gives the codes for entitys.</p>

<p>Hopefully now Iâ€™ll have a good way to track it down everytime I need it ðŸ˜€</p>
