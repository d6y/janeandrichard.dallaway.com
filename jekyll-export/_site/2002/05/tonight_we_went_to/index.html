<p>Tonight we went to see The Two Terries (<a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,6000,402366,00.html">Terry Jones</a> and <a href="http://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/">Terry Pratchett</a>) on stage at The Dome Concert Hall. We didn’t really know what to expect, and given that the Terries had never met before tonight, I guess they didn’t either. </p>

<p>For us, the worst thing it could have been was very very Literary — but it turned out to be mostly anecdote telling followed by questions at the end. There was a host to keep things moving, so all in all it was sort of like a chat show.</p>

<p>An entertaining chat show. For example: Terry Jones telling us about what life in the 14th century would have been like for a food taster to the Pope; or how the restaurant where the <a href="http://bau2.uibk.ac.at/sg/python/Images/tmol02.jpg">Mr Creosote</a> scene from The Meaning of Life was being used the next day for a wedding; or how Terry Pratchett may or may not stumble around hotel rooms at 5am trying to avoid peeing in the wardrobe. </p>

<p>One of the stranger things: Terry Jones showed us the scar he acquired after being in hospital. Apparently the surgeon took a photo of Terry while they were working on or around his intestines…and then emailed him <a href="http://pythonline.com/plugs/jones/hospital.pt2.shtml">the photo</a> (warning: that link not for the faint hearted or those eating). </p>

<p>The DVD of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005U0HG/richarddallaway">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a> sounds good at least for the subtitles for “people who don’t like the movie”, and we’ll have to go check out some of Terry Jones’ <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141307374/richarddallaway">books</a>. Jane already has pretty much all of the Pratchett <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385601239/richarddallaway">books</a> already.</p>

<p>Oh, brilliant moment: when it came round to time for questions, the first person stood up and said “This is a question for Terry” 🙂</p>
