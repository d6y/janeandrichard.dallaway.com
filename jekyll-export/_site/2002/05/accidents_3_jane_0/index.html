<p>What a bad cycling week. What with a small graze on my leg on Sunday when we were out cycling in the downs, and then <a href="/2002/05/nearly_an_accident">Tuesday’s incident</a> – the result of which was a nasty bruise, I should have known this was all leading up to something worse. This morning, I was cycling in the cycle lane down Preston Street (for those who don’t know Preston Street is a one way street going up, with a cycle lane going down) on a beautiful sunny morning, when a bloke appears from behind his van with a piece of aluminium sheeting which he slams into my hand. Fortunately, it was a glancing blow and I’ve only ended up with a small cut on my hand. Could have been a lot worse. Again, he didn’t seem too concerned about hitting me. I stopped my bike as soon as I could, and found myself being looked after by a lovely crew of builders who found me some plasters and took down the license plate of the van (just in case). Just as I was getting ready to leave, he reappeared with his boss and they both loitered around their van (about 20 metres further up the road) but didn’t bother to come and check if I was ok.</p>

<p>I pedalled on to work, and then went hunting antiseptics etc at our local <a href="http://www.wellbeing.com/index.jsp">Boots</a>. Paul (guy in the next office) suggested I get some Hydrogen Peroxide as it cleans wounds up well, and it fizzes which is an added bonus, oh and it can <a href="http://members.aol.com/nicholashl/ukspace/htp/htp.htm">fuel rockets</a>…. I did, it worked lovely (on the wound, haven’t tried a rocket yet), and I’m now sitting having a nice cup of tea (hey, I’m english, what can I say :-)) and a yummy Chocolate Brownie.</p>
