<p>After my <a href="/2002/05/accidents_3_jane_0">accident on Thursday</a>, I bought some <a href="http://www.savlon.co.uk/activheal/productcuts_frame.html">Activheal plasters</a> (supposedly help your wound to heal better – certainly worked pretty well, only my cut was in such an awkward place that it was hard to get a plaster to stick so I gave up after 2 days). On the back of the packet it says “Use once only”. Please tell me people don’t re-use plasters.</p>
