<p>My hatred of spammers increases by the day. The latest trick I’ve seen hitting my mailbox is spam that looks just like message failure reports. Messages from “Mail delivery subsystem” with a subject of “Returned mail: see transcript for details”. This is so annoying. Or would be, but luckily I use <a href="http://spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a> to clean my mailbox for me. Every so often I check the “spam” folder to see what it’s caught, and that’s why I’ve seen all these “Returned mail:” spam. SpamAssassin works; but how long before the spammers get the upper hand…?</p>
