<p>I was just listening to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live">Five Live</a> and heard a news story about a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/arts/newsid_1990000/1990836.stm">woman destroying lots of art work which her son had stolen</a>. Bizarre. If it isn’t bad enough that someone steals all this art work (worth £960m), but then to have his Mother destroy it all because she is angry with her son. Shocking!</p>
