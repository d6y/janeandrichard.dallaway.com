<p>When I ordered the Moby tickets, I decided to save the extra £1.25 and collect them from the box office. Only then did I remember that by November I’ll have changed my name and will have to go through a bit of a performance to prove that the tickets are really mine (Ticketmaster require you to have the purchasers credit card and the reference number as proof). And as I could only collect the tickets on the day, this didn’t give me much “proving I’m really me” time. So, I’ve arranged to have them posted to me instead with the hope that this will work out easier.</p>
