<p>I’ve just been having a look at some technology news on yahoo, and spotted <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=73&amp;ncid=738&amp;e=7&amp;u=/zd/20020524/tc_zd/5108178">this article</a> about six people being arrested on suspicion of being involved in the <a href="/2002/04/spam_scam">Nigerian email banking fraud</a>. It seems like they’d been managed to rake in hundreds of millions of US dollars during their time of operation.</p>
