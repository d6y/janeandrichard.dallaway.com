<p>Since <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/tv_and_radio/newsid_1961000/1961782.stm">ITVDigital</a>‘s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1961000/1961209.stm">shutdown</a> in the last couple of days, we’ve lost quite a few TV channels. It may be coincidence, but <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml">TiVO</a> has gone mad and has started recording all sorts of rubbish, such as <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/R/richardandjudy/">Richard and Judy</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/">Newsround Lite</a> (ok, not rubbish, but not something we need recording), and various other day-time TV junk. Poor thing must be desperate for things to record for us. Bless.</p>
