<p>Susie went to London on Saturday to do a few more touristy things, see a show and have dinner with her brother. Whilst she was there she popped into <a href="http://www.fortnumandmason.com/fm_prod/main.cfm">Fortnum and Mason</a>‘s. Being the sweetie that she is, she bought me a tin of Fortnum and Mason’s Drinking Chocolate Flakes. So, this afternoon, an afternoon when it’s wet and miserable outside, we’ve just been drinking some. And it’s lovely. It’s actually flakes of chocolate, not a powder as they usually are, and unusually it’s dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate – it’s just a shame that we’re only going to get 4 or 5 cups out of the 125g can. Yummmmm!</p>
