<p>Radios should be more like TVs. Dials? A limited number of stored stations labelled “1” or “2”? Why not have a bit of a screen, a few logos so I can select a channel and go there, rather than scanning for channels? Anyway… </p>

<p>I have a thing about needing a radio version of TiVo, and today Jane tempted me with a couple of URLs.</p>

<p><a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,437852,00.html">TiVo for radio’ set for UK launch</a> is a story in the Guardian… but from 14 Feb 2001. Alas <a href="http://www.commandaudio.com/">the company</a> in the article, sounds like it’s sort of lost the way. Shame. </p>

<p>The second, <a href="http://www.onmagazine.com/on-mag/reviews/article/0,9985,169142-1949,00.html">Bitbop Tuner is TiVo For Radio</a> is from Jul 27, 2001 sounded better, in that it’s a download for your PC. I go for the download button but the site has an important notice telling me that they’ve “discontinued distribution”.</p>

<p>(Amusing moment: The system requirements list “Minimum Ram: 64MB”, fine, “Processor: Absolutely Necessary” 🙂 </p>

<p>So it seems people have tried to make better radios, but there’s no money in it.</p>
