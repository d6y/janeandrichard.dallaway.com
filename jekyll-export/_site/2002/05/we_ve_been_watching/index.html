<p>We’ve been watching the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/football/uefa_cup/newsid_1973000/1973191.stm">UEFA Cup Final</a> this evening between Feyenoord and Borussia Dortmund. It’s been one of the dirtiest and cheaty matches I’ve seen for ages – players diving all over the place, a Dortmund player sent off after 32 minutes, 2 penalties – one to each team. And to cap it all there is a hoarding that says “Fair Play”, yeah right.</p>
