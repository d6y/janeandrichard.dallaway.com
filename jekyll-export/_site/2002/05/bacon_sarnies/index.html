<p>One day last week <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/susieleaving1/img_1897_640_bw-bw/">Susie</a> was complaining about being hungry and wanting lunch. It was 10am. We sent her over the road to our local greasy spoon to get a bacon buttie. She returned with sandwiches for all, and my bacon and mushroom sarnie was lovely and possibly one of the best I’ve ever had. Today, the weather is horrid (raining and windy and generally yuck) and we needed comfort food, and so we had bacon sandwiches for lunch. I was going to miss this and stick to the lunch I’d brought with me, but then realised that I couldn’t sit in an office with 3 people eating lovely, lardy, bacon butties. So, I gave in.</p>
