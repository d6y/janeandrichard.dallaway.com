<p>Well, here we go. World Cup coverage has started on the tv, and for the next month we have football to look forward to. Today we have the opening ceremony and the first game (France v Senegal) to watch. Iâ€™ll try not to let football take over my blogging for the next month, but, to be honest, chances are slim ðŸ™‚</p>
