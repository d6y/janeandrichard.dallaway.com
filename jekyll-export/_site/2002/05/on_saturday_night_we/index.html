<p>On Saturday night we cycled down to Preston Park to catch</p>

<p>Groupe F’s <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/PREVIEW2.html">A Little More Light</a> firework show. These are the people who did the fireworks around the Eiffel Tower for New Year’s eve 2000. It was impressive (but short) and I’ve not seen so many people for a long, long time. 15,000? No idea. </p>

<p>Actually, going cycling on a Saturday night felt like one of the nerdiest thing I’ve done for ages. But it was top fun.. especially having to twist and turn through so many cars and people on foot on their way to/from the fireworks. </p>

<p>This was at the end of the day, after having been caught up in the events of the <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/news/NEWS9.html">North Laine</a>. Jane’s put together <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/20020511/">the pictures</a>.</p>
