<p>There I was in Tesco’s minding my own business when I stumbled across <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000063TTQ/richarddallaway">The Sven-Göran Eriksson Classical Collection</a> in their CD section. It’s a 3 disc collection of Sven’s favourite classical music – alegedly. I must admit that this is something I can’t really imagine many of the previous England managers doing!</p>
