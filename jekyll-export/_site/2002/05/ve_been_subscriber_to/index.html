<p>I’ve been a subscriber to Wanderlust – a travel magazine designed for more independent travellers – for about 4 years now, and today I’ve been catching up on the last few editions. The first I read was the 50th edition, and had an article of 50 things to do in New Zealand – by my calculation we achieved 5.5 of them <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/nz2001.html">when we were there</a>. Must try harder next time :-). They also had a small article saying that they’d relaunched their <a href="http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/">website</a>. I’ve just been for a quick look, and it is much better than it was, being able to look at the <a href="http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/magazine/events.html">events section</a> is really handy. Well done Wanderlust.</p>
