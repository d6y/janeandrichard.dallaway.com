<p>I’ve just been listening to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/england/newsid_1997000/1997885.stm">England v South Korea</a> friendly on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live">Radio 5</a>. And didn’t we do well, not! We drew one all. Hmmm, not the start that we were hoping for I’m sure. It must be hard to bond a team together when you change 8 players between the interval and the end of the second half. Surely that makes it hard to play together as a team.</p>

<p>And how does this affect our chances in the World Cup, well it doesn’t really, except that there might be some negative press comments and that always seems to spur England on. The chances of us getting beyond the first round have to be slim, the climate doesn’t suit the Europeans very much, and Nigeria and Argentina are both pretty strong. And Argentina are one of our two bogey teams (fact: in the 5 most recent competitions we’ve been knocked out by only 2 teams – Argentina and Germany (or West Germany as it was before)).</p>
