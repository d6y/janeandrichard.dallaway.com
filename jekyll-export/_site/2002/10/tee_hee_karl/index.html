<p>Tee hee…. Karl texted me to tell me that <a href="http://www.aspectgroup.co.uk/">Aspect</a> had re-launched their website. I was taking a look around it, and spotted a few mistakes, so thought I’d be nice and email them about them. So, I go to their <a href="http://www.aspectgroup.co.uk/contact/">contact</a> page and choose the Feedback email address (“for suggestions and comments about this site”). Email them my comments, and what do I get back? A message from the postmaster telling me that the address doesn’t exist. Well done Aspect!</p>
