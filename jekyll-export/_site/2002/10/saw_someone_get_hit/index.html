<p>I saw someone get hit by a car yesterday. Actually, I heard a loud “thump” and turned around to see a car come to a halt and a man lying on the floor. He seemed a bit dazed but got up, but the driver of the car was hysterical. She jumped out of the car screaming and ran over to the man, and fell over in the process. The whole thing was surprisingly disturbing for an onlooker. On a plus note, an ambulance arrived very quickly. I don’t know what happened to the man — I think he walked away — but when I passed that way again the driver was being calmed down by the ambulance crew.</p>

<p>So: Take care when crossing between parked cars. And I think I’ll slow down in city traffic…. I don’t want to end up like that driver.</p>
