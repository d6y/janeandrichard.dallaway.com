<p>We’ve been working on a new site recently – it’s a travel and activity type site, with an associated shop. The gear seems to be pretty good quality so far, and I’m quite pleased with the functionality we managed to deliver – all with either open source products, or written with <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>. So, go and take a look at <a href="http://www.igloolife.com">Igloo Life</a>.</p>
