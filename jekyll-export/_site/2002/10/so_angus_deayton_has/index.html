<p>So, Angus Deayton has been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2373711.stm">sacked</a> from “<a href="http://www.hignfy.net/">Have I got News For You</a>“. Mind you, Jeremy pointed out that on Friday, HIGNFY is against the first episode of “<a href="http://www.mtv.co.uk/mtv.co.uk/en/dynamo/the_osbournes/microsite.htm">The Osbournes</a>“. So… is it a ploy to make sure the BBC get lots of viewers?</p>
