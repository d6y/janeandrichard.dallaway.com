<p>Richard and I went and gave blood yesterday at our local session. It was relatively painless, and didn’t take too long. What percentage of the UK population do you think gives blood? 6%. That’s all. Poor isn’t it. No wonder that the National Blood Service have increased the number of donations you can make in a year to 3, they need to rely on their existing donors to meet the demand. You can find out more about giving blood at <a href="http://www.blood.co.uk">blood.co.uk</a>.</p>
