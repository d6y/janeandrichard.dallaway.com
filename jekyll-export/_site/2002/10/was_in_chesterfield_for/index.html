<p>I was in Chesterfield for the first 2 days of this week doing some work for <a href="http://www.imagesound.co.uk">Imagesound</a> and decided that it was close enough to Hull to make it worthwhile doing the extra hour and a half hour drive to go and see my Parents. So I did, and on the way back on Tuesday morning, I drove past a house with Christmas decorations outside – it’s October damn it! I did a total double take, and no really, really it was there! Shocking!</p>
