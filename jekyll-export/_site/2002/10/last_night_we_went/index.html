<p>Last night we went to see</p>

<p>the <a href="http://www.brightonbears.com/">Brighton Bears</a></p>

<p>play the <a href="http://www.tvtigers.co.uk/">Thames Valley Tigers</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first basketball game we’ve been to. Before the game I</p>

<p>had a quick look at the rules so we had a chance of understanding the game. Glad</p>

<p>I did because otherwise we’d have no idea why there was a clock that counted down</p>

<p>from 24 seconds. Still don’t understand what is and isn’t a foul, but there’s</p>

<p>plenty of time to read-up on the rules over</p>

<p>at the <a href="http://www.bbl.org.uk/">British Basketball League</a> web site. </p>

<p>The Bears won <a href="http://www.brightonbears.com/news/news_detail.asp?news_id=92">88-63</a>, and all the players were impressive, especially <a href="http://www.brightonbears.com/team/randy_duck.asp">the captain</a>. </p>

<p>It’s fast, entertaining, and I think we’ll go again. And the crowd turn out was impressive, too.</p>
