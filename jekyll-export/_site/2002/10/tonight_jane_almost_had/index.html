<p>Tonight Jane almost had me in tears. We were listening to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000I25G/richarddallaway">Electric Landlady</a> and Jane said: “Oh, I’d forgotten <a href="http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/">Kirsty MacColl</a> was <a href="http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/news/cozumel.htm">dead</a>. I was just thinking it was about time for another album”. I’d erased that fact.. Most upsetting.</p>

<p>Anyway… yesterday afternoon I was at <a href="http://www.linuxexpo.co.uk/">Linux Expo</a> at Olympia in London. Mostly dull and very quiet. They had someone walking around in a giraffe costume. I can only assume the hire shop ran out of <a href="http://www.sjbaker.org/tux/">penguin</a> outfits and substituted something they thought would be alright. But hey, I got to catch up with <a href="http://www.hodgkinson.org/">Dave</a> and see what he’s <a href="http://www.slashrock.com/">up to</a>.</p>

<p>In the evening I caught up with Jane and the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com">New Scientist</a> folk for <a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/view_review_details.asp?Version=Pubbar&amp;ReviewID=775">some beers</a> and then we headed off to <a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/view_review_details.asp?Version=Pubbar&amp;ReviewID=1121">Akbar</a> to Suran’s pre-show party for <a href="http://www.suran.net">anjali</a>. Drank too much, way too much passive smoking, but we had fun.</p>
