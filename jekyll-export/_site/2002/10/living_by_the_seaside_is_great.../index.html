<p>…because it means that since we <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/08/today_is_office_move">moved to our new office</a> I can go for a walk along the seafront at lunch time. And at lunch time there aren’t many people around at this end of the promenade (near Hove Lagoon) and so it’s peaceful and all you can hear is the noise of the sea. It’s great for people watching too. Today there was a guy wearing just a pair of shorts fishing, a couple sitting on a bench making their lunch (bread, butter, cucumber for sandwiches), a lady coming back from a swim, a guy painting his beach hut and other people just wandering along.</p>
