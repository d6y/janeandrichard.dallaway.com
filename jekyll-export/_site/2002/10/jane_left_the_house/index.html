<p>Jane left the house at 5.30am this morning to head off up north for a bit of consulting work. Half an hour later than usual. Once the sun had come up, I headed out to grab a cup of coffee. With the sun shining and a lovely blue sky I had one of those great walk-in-the-city-while-no-one-is-about times. I headed down to the beach to see if there was any damage after <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2367089.stm">the big storms</a>, but there was nothing. There were some surfers in the sea, but it was pretty calm. Big empty beach, sun shining… it’s good living by the sea.</p>
