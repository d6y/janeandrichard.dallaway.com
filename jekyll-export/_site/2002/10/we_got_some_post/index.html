<p>We got some post at work today from the “Data Protection Registration Agency”. It was a form to fill in to be registered and to comply with the Data Protection Act 1988. It had “Final Notice” across the top of the form. Duncan had filled it all in, before we realised it was a scam. They were asking for £95 + VAT as an administration fee. The form had a government look about it, but wasn’t quite right – that’s how we spotted it. I then did a quick search on google and found <a href="http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk/dpars.htm">this article</a>. Cheeky, cheeky people.</p>
