<p>A while ago I read the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857025717/richarddallaway">Longitude</a> book. Maybe I read it too quickly, or missed a bit, but I never really understood how</p>

<p>you’d navigate in the 1700s using the stars and trying to figure out the time in London. Anyway, the other night I was catching up on an episode of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/theship/index.shtml">The Ship</a> and it all became clear: if you know it’s noon where you are right now, and you know the time back in London, you can figure out how far east or west you are. Simple. </p>

<p>In other TV news, you should have been watching</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/index.html">Scrubs</a> and</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/">Six Feet Under</a> (the title sequence alone should have won awards … oh,hold on, it <em>did</em>: two <a href="http://www.emmys.com/primetime/2002/2002awards.html">Emmys</a>).</p>
