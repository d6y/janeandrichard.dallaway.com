<p>We had a quick break last week, and went to Malta for a few days. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622759167440/">photos</a> are now up, as is the <a href="/2002/01/malta/">travel report</a>.</p>

<p>Generally though it was nice to get a break, especially after all the entertaining we’d done over Christmas, even though Malta wasn’t quite as warm and sunny as it normally would be in January.</p>
