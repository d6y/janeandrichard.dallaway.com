<p>Paul, Richard and I took our mountain bikes out yesterday for a ride. We decided we didn’t want to do a long ride as Rich was recovering from a cold, and I’d been cycling to work and back during the week. So, we left Paul’s place in Kemp Town and headed off along Roedean Road. Then we headed off the road on a bridleway passing Brighton East Golf Club (this was a pretty steep hill), and onto a muddy track to the top of Red Hill. We had a great downhill stretch, although I wasn’t brave enough to let the brakes off too much as there was so much mud about and I could feel my back wheel slipping away under me. This was a really good bridleway, and brought us into Ovingdean. We cycled through Ovingdean and joined another path heading towards Rottingdean. We had a short stop at Rottingdean (next time, we’re going to take bike locks with us so we can have a quick pint or something similar – although we were all pretty muddy by this point and so might not have been welcome at some places) and then cycled along the Undercliff path back to the Marina. We cycled through the Marina Village and then along Marine Parade. Paul headed off back up Dukes Mound to his house, and we cycled along the seafront to ours. This was a really good route, and I think we might be trying similar routes again as there seem to be a lot of good tracks around the Ovingdean, Rottingdean, Woodingdean areas.</p>

<p>We used the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0319219291/richarddallaway">Explorer 122</a> Ordnance Survey map to plan and follow our route.</p>
