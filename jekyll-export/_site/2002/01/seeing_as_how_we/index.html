<p>Seeing as how we’re doing more cycling, we thought we’d buy some proper cycling clothes. Someone had recommended <a href="http://www.groundeffect.co.nz">Ground Effect</a> to us despite them being in New Zealand. We had a look at their stuff, and it certainly looked a bit cooler than some of the other manufacturers, and a whole lot better than what we could find in the shops around Brighton. We made our order on Monday evening, and today the first set of clothing arrived – a pair of <a href="http://www.groundeffect.co.nz/tom-thumbs.htm">Tom Thumbs</a> (cycling shorts), some <a href="http://www.groundeffect.co.nz/witches.htm">Witches Britches</a>, a <a href="http://www.groundeffect.co.nz/presto.htm">Presto</a> top and a pair of <a href="http://www.groundeffect.co.nz/ranchsliders.htm">RanchSliders</a> for Richard. We’re pretty impressed with the delivery time – half way around the world in 4.5 days. Hopefully, it’ll stop raining before tomorrow and we can try some of our new purchases out.</p>
