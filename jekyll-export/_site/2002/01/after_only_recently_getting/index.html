<p>After only recently getting into “Stargate: SG-1”, today we learn that there’s going to be a movie (<a href="http://www.scifiguide.net/stargate/movies/02.shtml">Stargate II</a>) featuring the cast of SG-1. Hurrah. But… they won’t be making any more SG-1s after series six. Boo. But there will be a spin-off series, called <a href="http://www.scifiguide.net/stargate/news/spinoffnews.shtml">Stargate Atlantis</a>. So all is not lost, and anyway… as we’re only just watching series 1, we’ve got a lot of catching up to do. </p>
