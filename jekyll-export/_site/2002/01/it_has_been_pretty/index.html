<p>It has been pretty windy around here lately, and yesterday I cycled home along the sea front. What was quite interesting was that the sea had been so powerful that it had picked heaps of pebbles off the beach and dumped it on the promenade above. Really bizarre!</p>

<p>Of course, our weather has been mild compared to the North of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland â€“ for more information, see what the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1788000/1788166.stm">BBC News</a> had to say about it.</p>
