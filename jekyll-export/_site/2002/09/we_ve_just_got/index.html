<p>We’ve just got back from New England. Photos and report later, but for now I’d just like to make a nomination for Worst E-commerce Web Site Ever. The winner is… <a href="http://www.ducktours.com">Boston Duck Tours</a>. They give you lots of warnings about not using your back button. OK, fair enough, but when you do make a mistake you’re dumped to a page that has no links on it: you’re trapped, because you’re not allowed to use your back button. And the mistake I made? Not selecting a “state” when trying to order tickets from the UK (there’s no “outside US” option in the list of US states). I couldn’t fake a US address because the address has to match the credit card number. So there I was, suck on a “you must enter a state” error page, after all ready entering my credit card number. Bah. And they charge you $2 extra for booking online. </p>

<p>No, we didn’t take their tour. Yes, I’ve told them about their web site, but they didn’t bother to reply. </p>

<p>Sorry… I’ll try not to rant in future. Must think calm, happy thoughts.</p>
