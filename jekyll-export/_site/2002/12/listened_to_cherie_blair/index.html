<p>I listened to Cherie Blair’s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2563751.stm">statement</a> on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live">Radio 5</a> on the way back from Chesterfield last night about the whole <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2546835.stm">Peter Foster and flat buying</a> thing. It left me with a couple of questions – why are there <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2547617.stm">2 flats in Bristol</a> – what is the other one for?, and why isn’t student accommodation good enough for their son? With a government policy that seems to be making it <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/education/2002/higher_education_review/">increasingly hard for students to survive without debt</a>, why should he get such a helping hand? I also hadn’t realised that he had <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1691165.stm">government officials helping him with his homework</a> this time last year! Nice!</p>
