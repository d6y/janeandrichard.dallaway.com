<p>I got a copy of November’s Saveur magazine in the post today, and if you look on page 16, you’ll see <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/bonfire_2001/img_0854_640/">this picture</a>, and at the bottom of the column, it says “courtesy Jane Fothergill”. One of my photos is in print 😀</p>
