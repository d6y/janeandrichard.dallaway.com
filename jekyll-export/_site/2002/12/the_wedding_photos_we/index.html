<p>The <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedding/photos/Official/">wedding photos</a> we’d chosen to be enlarged arrived yesterday – so now we have to find some way to store them. We’re looking for plastic covers and then possibly a box. We’ve also ended up buying the samples from <a href="http://www.pjweddings.com/">Pete</a> so these, with the table cameras and other people’s photos will be put together into a couple of albums to record the day. A job for over Christmas I think.</p>
