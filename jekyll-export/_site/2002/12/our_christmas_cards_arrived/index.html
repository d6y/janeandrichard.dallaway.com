<p>Our Christmas cards arrived from <a href="http://www.charitycards.co.uk">CharityCards.co.uk</a> arrived today, so we can now get on with writing them. It seems like we’ve only just finished writing Thank You cards for all our very generous friends after the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedding/">wedding</a>. Maybe we should have gone for the <a href="http://www.charitycards.co.uk/top.php?id=146">Personalised Christmas Cards</a> so we didn’t have to write anything – somehow though at the time that seemed just too impersonal, now I’m beginning to think it would have been a great idea!</p>
