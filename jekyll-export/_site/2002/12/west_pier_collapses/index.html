<p>This morning, at around 9am, some of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2612805.stm">West Pier collapsed into the sea</a>. We didn’t know anything about it until it was mentioned on the 5pm news so we’ve not been down to see it. Probably will do tomorrow though armed with the camera. There has been a lot of discussion about the <a href="http://www.westpier-trust.demon.co.uk/restoration.html">future of the West Pier</a>, this looks like it might do away with the restoration plans which is a real shame as I think it’s a <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/brightonphotoday/img_0981_640/">beautiful building</a>.</p>
