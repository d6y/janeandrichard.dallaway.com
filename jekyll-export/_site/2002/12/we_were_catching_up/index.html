<p>We were catching up on our tv watching last night and watched a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/">Horizon</a> from last week – about homeopathy. It was interesting, and the experiments were interesting. But, the experiments they were doing was to test the “<a href="http://www.geocities.com/healthbase/homeopathy_memory.html">Memory of Water</a>“. Now, this relates to the fact that a homepathy concentration has no molecules in it – so how can it work? The theory was that the water has a memory of what active ingredients it had in before it was diluted. Now, the experiments they did were very controlled. They took one drop of histimine and put it into 99 drops of water. Then they repeated this process (1 drop of the new solution to 99 drops of water) until they’d got it to the equivalent of less than one drop in the entire seas in the world. So pretty concentrated then! They tested this solution against a control solution – just water. The results came out that there was no proof that it worked – some control solutions worked, some concentrated solutions worked. So they couldn’t say that the homeopathy principal worked.</p>

<p>Interesting, but… this is what got me. If you’re testing whether water has a memory, then how can your control solution be water? Surely, all water will have a memory won’t it?</p>
