<p>Today we managed to get down to take a look at the West Pier and see how much had collapsed. It was a perfect opportunity for me to play with my new camera, and so there are a set of <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2002-12-30/">photos</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve actually had the time to play with a few of the images, following instructions found on <a href="http://cs.uhh.hawaii.edu/~jeschke/photography/articles/gimp/tutorials.shtml">Eric Jeschke</a>‘s site specifically for <a href="http://gimp.org/">The Gimp</a> (the image manipulation application I use) – and so I’ve used a different technique for making colour images black and white, and have also added a bit of grain to <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2002-12-30/img_3924_bw_grain/">one</a>. Top Marks to Eric for making really easy to understand instructions.</p>
