<p>I found a perfect Christmas present for <a href="http://www.jonoabroad.com">Jono</a> today – it was a cuddly moose in our local Safeway, with a Christmas hat saying “Merry X-Moose” on it’s jumper. But seeing as how a) we brought him a moose finger puppet back from our honeymoon, and b) he’s leaving the country on the 28th for good 🙁 it didn’t seem worth buying for him. So, instead, he’ll have to make do with <a href="http://www.millan.net/funp/20/xmoose.html">this</a>.</p>
