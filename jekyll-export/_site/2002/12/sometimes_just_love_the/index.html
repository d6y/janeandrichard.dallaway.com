<p>Sometimes I just love the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC News</a> site. Today they’ve posted <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2565041.stm">this</a> – a statement from Santa explaining that he does exist despite what <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2562109.stm">Reverend Lee Rayfield said in a carol service</a>. And better still there are distinct wording similaries to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2563751.stm">Cherie’s statement</a>. Nice one Beeb!</p>
