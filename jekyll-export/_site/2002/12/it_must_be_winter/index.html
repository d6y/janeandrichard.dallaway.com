<p>It must be winter because we’ve mentioned TV twice in todays blogs….</p>

<p>The Web Review isn’t a particularly interesting <a href="http://www.thewebreview.com/">web site</a> but it makes strangely compelling TV (ITV, no idea when… probably the very small hours of the morning). They give a quick review of a web site and then chat about it. Sounds dull, but the <a href="http://www.thewebreview.com/presenter.htm">presenters</a> make it something I’d watch again.</p>
