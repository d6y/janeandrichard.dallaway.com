<p>Well done Ireland. We’ve just been listening to the Ireland v Saudi Arabia game on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive">Radio 5</a> in the office and it’s been a great game to listen to. I’m planning on watching the highlights on the tv later tonight. Now, I just want England to do the same tomorrow and get through to the second round as well. Come on England.</p>
