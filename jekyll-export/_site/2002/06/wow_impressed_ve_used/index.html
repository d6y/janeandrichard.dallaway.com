<p>Wow, I’m impressed. I’ve used the <a href="http://www.pixology.com">pixology</a> service quite a few times now to get digital photos produced on photographic paper and the service has always been pretty good. I send a set through on Tuesday (passport photos as well as some other snaps) and the photos arrived through the post this morning. Such a fast turnaround is so impressive. Unfortunately, my passport photos are too dark so I’m going to have to lighten them up before I send them off again.</p>
