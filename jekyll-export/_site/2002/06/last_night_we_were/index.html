<p>Last night we were at a photo exhibition at the</p>

<p><a href="http://www.artsoutheast.co.uk/member_home.cfm?name=gardner">Gardner Arts Centre</a> called</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/USIS/now/event.cfm?id=2556">It’s Wrong to Wish on Space Hardware</a>. The trigger to go was the combination of having a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0792237145/richarddallaway">Orbit: NASA Astronauts Photograph the Earth</a> and also loving the <a href="http://www.billybragg.co.uk/">Billy Bragg</a> song that the title is taken from (<a href="http://www.billybragg.co.uk/releases/albums/life_riot_spy/life4.html">New England</a>). </p>

<p>It was a free exhibition, and it was of a size that occupied us for about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>There was a mix of stuff: official NASA prints (my personal favourites), photos of the Russian space programme (best: a cosmonaut ready to go, but sitting on a nasty 70s sofa in what looked like someone’s living room), plus fake space shots: pictures of pancakes that resembled the moon, and windscreen bug splat that looked like the night sky.</p>
