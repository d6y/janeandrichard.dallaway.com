<p>We watched a new tv programme – <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/">Six Feet Under</a> – last night (it was actually shown on Monday, but I’d got <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml">Tivo</a> to record it because the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a> had said it was a must watch). It was really entertaining and very well put together (Alan Ball, producer of American Beauty, is one of the directors). From the show’s website </p>

<p>“<em>One of the most acclaimed shows of the 2001 season, SIX FEET UNDER takes a darkly comic look at the Fishers, a dysfunctional family who own and operate an independent funeral home in Los Angeles. Patriarch Nathaniel Fisher is no longer living (except in the hearts and visions of his family). So his wife Ruth, sons Nate and David, and daughter Claire are left to cope with the routine and not-so-routine aspects of life in the grief-management business.</em>“. </p>

<p>As usual, we’re trailing behind the Americans here, and they’re already on to Season 2.</p>

<p>One of the more annoying things was that I recognised the actress who plays Brenda Chenowith – Rachel Griffiths, but couldn’t remember where I knew her from. Thanks to <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/cast_and_crew/rachel_griffiths_actor.shtml">her biography</a> I find that it’s because she was Rhonda in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0110598">Muriel’s Wedding</a> (which incidently is one of our favourite films).</p>

<p>The next episode is showing on <a href="http://www.channel4.com/">Channel 4</a> on Monday evening at 11.10pm – set the video for it.</p>
