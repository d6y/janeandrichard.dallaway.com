<p>On Friday evening we went on a bit of a pub crawl as Susie’s leaving do. But this was no ordinary pub crawl – we played pub golf. We had a 9 pub golf course and we had a set drink and amount to do in every pub. To make par we had to drink what was on the card. To get a birdie we had to drink double the quantity, an eagle was double the quantity and a single spirit, an albatross was double the quantity and a double spirit and a hole in one was an albatross downed in one!</p>

<p>Our course and drinks were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.grandbrighton.co.uk/">Grand Hotel</a> – Long Island Ice Tea or other cocktail – Par 3</li>
  <li>The Walkabout Lodge – Pint – Par 5</li>
  <li>The Fiddlers Elbow – Half – Par 4</li>
  <li>The Cricketers – Half – Par 4</li>
  <li>The Bath Arms – Pint – Par 5</li>
  <li>The Font and Firkin – Half – Par 3</li>
  <li>The Victory – Half – Par 4</li>
  <li>The Western Front – Half – Par 3</li>
  <li>Weatherspoons – Pint – Par 5</li>
</ul>

<p>We only got as far as the Western Front by closing time, so both Weatherspoons and the club House (The Grand Hotel again) were missed out on. Not a great shame really as we’d all had quite enough to drink by then. Don’t forget to take a look at <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/Susieleaving2/">the photos</a>.</p>
