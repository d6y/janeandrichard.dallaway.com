<p>And I’ve just spotted <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/worldcup/get_involved/riochants.shtml">this</a>, a page dedicated to chants about Rio Ferdinand, to the tune of Duran Duran’s Rio. My current favourite is “His name is Rio and he plays for Engerland, Oh Rio, Rio take us to the promised land.”</p>
