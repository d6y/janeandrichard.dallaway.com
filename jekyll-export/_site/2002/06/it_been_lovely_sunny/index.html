<p>It’s been a lovely, sunny day today and it was really great to get a text message from Jeremy to say that <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/Susieleaving2/img_2008_640/">he and Kirsty</a> were going to head down to the beach for a barbeque and did we want to join them. We’d already got some food sorted out as we’d planned to have one over the weekend anyways, and so we went and joined them and we spent a very pleasant afternoon feasting ourselves on chicken wings, sausages, lamb kebabs etc whilst drinking a couple of beers. Just what Sunday afternoons are made for.</p>
