<p>On Friday evening, after the football we went out for a few beers with Jeremy and Kirsty. As we were leaving the pub (the Three Jolly Butchers in Brighton) there were a 4 people with white scientist coats on and a large bin on wheels. We decided to see what it was all about and found out that they were giving out packets of Shoks (new crisp snacks made by <a href="http://www.hulahoops.co.uk/">Hula Hoops</a>).</p>

<p>We tried them today, we had a packet of Totally Cheesy and a packet of Full-On Onion ones. They’re like hula hoops, only smaller. The onion ones weren’t particularly oniony but the cheesy ones were okay. Both tasted of artificial flavouring though.</p>
