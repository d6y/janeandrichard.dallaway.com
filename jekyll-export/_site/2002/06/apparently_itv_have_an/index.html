<p>Apparently ITV have an answer to <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/05/mini_motty">mini Motty</a>, you can also download <a href="http://www.itv-worldcup.co.uk/static/desk_top_des/index.html">Desktop Des</a>, a mini Des Lynam to sit on your desktop. Desktop Des appears to be sponsored by <a href="http://shakeyourtictacs.co.uk/">Tic Tac</a> and doesn’t do as many interesting things as Motty, but even Motty is quite delayed with his goal reports unfortunately 🙁 I think I’ll stick with Motty as well as the radio/tv coverage.</p>
