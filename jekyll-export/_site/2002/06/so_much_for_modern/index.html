<p>So much for modern technology and government initiatives. The <a href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk">Inland Revenue</a> <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/06/having_gathered_together_all">still</a> haven’t got their self-assesment service back on line yet. It has to be completed by the end of September and I just want to get on with it, so I’ve resorted to calling them up and asking them to send me a form through. It *really* grates to have to resort to filling in paper based forms, but I want to get it out of the way before the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedlog/">wedding</a> build-up really starts. Bah!</p>
