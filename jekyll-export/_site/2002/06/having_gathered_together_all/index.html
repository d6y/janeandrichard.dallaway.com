<p>Having gathered together all the information I need to fill in my tax return for 2001/02 online – mostly I’ve been waiting for the <a href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk">Inland Revenue</a> to send me a username for the site – I was somewhat concerned to read that this facility has been withdrawn “whilst we are carrying out system assurance checks” (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/23/25522.html">apparently users could view other users tax returns</a> – doh!). Guess I’ll have to wait until they fix the problem.</p>
