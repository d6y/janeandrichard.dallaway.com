<p>We’ve been out searching for office space this afternoon and unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be that much quality space available in the Brighton area. We only looked at one place today and it reminded me of a student house, dark and a bit dingey. It was a flat really, not purpose built office space and it had a pale pink and black bathroom, complete with a bath! Not very professional looking really.</p>
