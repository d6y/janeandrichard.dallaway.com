<p>We were bored so we caught up on a back-log of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Frasier/about/index.html">Frasier</a>‘s we had to watch. It’s still good, but it’s not a must watch any more, hence the accumulation. Anyway… one thing that struck me about a couple of the episodes was the terrible, terrible product placement. They had a <a href="http://www.segway.com/">Segway</a> in one episode and a <a href="http://www.aibo.com/">Aibo</a> in another. They were in the show for no reason at all, and did nothing for the story. I prefer to take my product placement in a more subtile, subliminal way, thanks. For the Segway or an Aibo I’d happily sit and watch a 30 minute infomercial. No need to “sneek” them into a show like Frasier.</p>
