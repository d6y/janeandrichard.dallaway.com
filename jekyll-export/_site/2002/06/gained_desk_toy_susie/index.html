<p>I gained a desk toy! Susie left me her <a href="http://www.zekeinc.com/prod2.htm">Peekin’ Zeke</a>. My new adopted friend is the 4th one down, the rainbow one. Apparently <em>Peekin’ Zeke’s nose and hands can even hold onto your notes and memos</em>. I’ll have to give that a try later, once he’s settled in.</p>
