<p>Someone on <a href="http://www.brightonnewmedia.org">BNM</a> posted a link to <a href="http://www.showingthegame.net/">Showing The Game Information Service</a>. This is being run in Sussex during the World Cup as a pilot scheme, and it sounds like a great idea. An easy way to make sure that you find a pub that is showing a game, and also get an idea on whether the pub has a big screen or just a normal tv.</p>
