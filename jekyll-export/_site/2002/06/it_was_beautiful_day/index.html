<p>It was a beautiful day here in Brighton yesterday and so we went for a walk along the beach and decided to stop for a pint. This was a really splendid way of spending time, drinking beer watching the wakeboarders fall in the sea. We then headed off to the <a href="http://www.brightonnewmedia.org">BNM</a> social at the <a href="http://www.sussexarts.com/">Sussex Arts Club</a> (quite an interesting place) and met some new people, and met up with some we’d met before. As we were heading home, we discovered that one of the restaurants in Boyce’s Street is being refitted to become a <a href="http://www.nandos.co.uk/">Nando’s</a> and is due to open in August. This is great news for us as Nando’s is one of the only things we’ve missed about not being in Ealing. Nando’s is great takeaway food, tasty chicken with a peri peri sauce. Yummmm! Roll on August.</p>
