<p>Yay! Go England. We go through to the next round and the Nigerians and the Argentines go home. For a 0-0 draw it was pretty tense stuff at times but, weâ€™re through and we play Denmark at lunchtime on Saturday.</p>

<p>I watched it at home and then cycled in to work to start the rest of my day â€“ flexi time is a wonderful thing ðŸ™‚</p>
