<p>Friday was another warm evening where we ended up having a couple of beers on the beach, this time at</p>

<p><a href="http://www.itchybrighton.co.uk/venues/369.html">Gemini bar</a> (see also: <a href="http://www.brightonlife.com/reviews/reviews_add.php3?venue_id=67">this review</a>). Then we jumped on train to go and see our friends at <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/">New Scientist</a> who were having a party at <a href="http://www.ormonds.com/">Ormonds</a> in London to celebrate their winning the <a href="http://www.ppa.co.uk/pr/2002/0508oscars.htm">Interactive Consumer Magazine of the Year</a> award. It was great to catch up with everyone (thanks for invite!) and well done, guys!</p>
