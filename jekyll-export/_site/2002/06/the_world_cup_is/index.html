<p>The world cup is really starting to get interesting now. 4 of the teams to make it to the quarter finals are not who I expected to see there. So, the quarters line up as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>England v Brazil – Friday 7.30am UK time</li>
  <li>Germany v USA – Friday 12.30pm UK time</li>
  <li>Spain v South Korea – Saturday 7.30am UK time</li>
  <li>Senegal v Turkey – Saturday 12.30pm UK time</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some interesting and hard to call matches there.</p>
