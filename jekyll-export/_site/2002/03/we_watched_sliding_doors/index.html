<p>We watched “<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120148">Sliding Doors</a>” last night – <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml">Tivo</a> had recorded it for us at Christmas, and we hadn’t got around to watching it (we’d seen it at the cinema years ago). As the ending credits ran I was really surprised to hear a Dido track on it, and I’d wondered if this had been added to the film later, but a quick scan on <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Soundtracks?0120148">imdb soundtracks</a> seems to say it was original. It’s strange how Dido didn’t seem to become well known here until 2 or so years later.</p>
