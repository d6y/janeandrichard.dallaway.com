<p>Well, I played my second game of squash tonight – Susie is teaching me how to play. Unfortunately, whilst we were warming up the ball I managed to pull a muscle so I played the whole time with a bit of a limp (much to Susie’s amusement). I obviously didn’t do enough <a href="http://www.scottishsport.co.uk/squash/DaveHeath/DaveHeathSaysStretch.htm">stretching</a> but I will next time.</p>
