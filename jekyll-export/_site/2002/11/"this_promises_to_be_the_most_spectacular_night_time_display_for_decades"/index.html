<p>I’ve just been out looking for the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2481681.stm">Leonid meteor shower</a>, but I saw nothing. Brighton’s too bright, there’s too much cloud and having an almost full moon can’t help. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a meteor shower.</p>

<p>Now, do I set my alarm for 4am to see if the situation has changed? Mmmm… no.</p>
