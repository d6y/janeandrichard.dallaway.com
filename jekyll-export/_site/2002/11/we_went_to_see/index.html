<p>We went to see <a href="http://www.moby.com">Moby</a> last night at the <a href="http://www.brightoncentre.co.uk/">Brighton Centre</a>. He was supported by Lamb (who were a bit lame really – a strange blend between <a href="http://www.echobelly.com/">Echobelly</a> and <a href="http://www.bjork.com/">Bjork</a> but not as good as either – but they kept telling us that we were a “wicked audience”. Which was nice!).</p>

<p>Moby was a surprise. It was a lot punkier and louder than I’d expected, and there were more real musical instruments – for some reason I’d expected a lot of sampled sounds rather than real, live, instruments. He is a pretty manic stage presence, running around the stage and it’s no wonder that, as Jeremy put it, “He’s a skinny thing”. It was a really good concert, even if it did take quite a while for my ears to recover… surely a sign that I’m getting old!?!</p>
