<p>I was emailed a job spec today from a company who used to have me on their books after I was made <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/11/well_survived_rounds_of">redundant last year</a> – among many other, very detailed, requirements they want “fluently trilingual”. But they don’t mention what languages! The job is in Brussels so I assume it’s English, French and Flemish but…. Could I apply with English, Yorkshire and Hull as my three languages that I can fluently converse in?</p>
