<p>Brighton was packed with police yesterday. Back at home, I was flipping through the TV channels trying to catch the local news to see if they had any information (nope) but I found “What the papers say” on BBC2. Their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/whatthepaperssay">newspaper photo of the year</a> nominations are interesting. I think I’ll vote for the “John Major and his lady friends” photo (at the time of writing the “Argentinian handbags” has the most votes, just ahead of “11 September”).</p>
