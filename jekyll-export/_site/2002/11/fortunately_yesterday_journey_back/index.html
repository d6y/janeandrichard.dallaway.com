<p>Fortunately, yesterday’s journey back from Chesterfield to Brighton was much smoother than <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/11/yesterday_was_the_worst">last weeks</a> and I got home only 10 minutes late. A miracle!</p>

<p>Yesterday I used my time wisely – I listened to a talk by Tim O’Reilly (him of the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O’Reilly books</a>) on “<a href="http://technetcast.ddj.com/tnc_play_stream.html?stream_id=696">The shape of things to come</a>“, I read some more of my current work-related book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0340824867/richarddallaway">“Love is the killer App” by Tim Sanders</a> (another good read, this time about the power of networking with other people and helping people out – being a “lovecat”). I also then decided it was time to work through my address book in my Handera, and so started emailing people I hadn’t heard from in a while. Some of them have dissapeared off the face of the earth, but I’ve had some lovely responses from others. A good use of those 4 hours travelling time.</p>

<p>Oh yes, I was also sneezing and sniffing a fair bit as I seem to have become a bit of a snot monster again. I’m taking today off and am sitting at home trying to rest up and recover.</p>
