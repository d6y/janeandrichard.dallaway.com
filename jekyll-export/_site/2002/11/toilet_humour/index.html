<p>Us Brits are pretty well famed for liking <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_humour">toilet humour</a>. We visited Rachel and Steve the other weekend, and my Godson, Thomas, who is now 4, is obsessed with the words “pooh” and “wee” and the funniest thing he can think of is to call someone “poohy wee-wee head”. He’ll shout that out and then disolve into laughter for ages. Strange isn’t it! The question is tho, is this something that only British children find funny? And if that is the case, what do other Nation’s children find really, really funny at 4 years old?</p>
