<p>During my journey yesterday I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0932633013/richarddallaway">The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and Getting Advice Successfully</a> which is a really well written book. Iâ€™m normally not very good at reading these serious, work related books, but I found this to be pretty good. Lots of good advice, and lots of humour.</p>
