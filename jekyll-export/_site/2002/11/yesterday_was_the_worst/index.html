<p>Yesterday was the worst Chesterfield to Brighton journey to date. I took the train again, and decided (very sensibly as it turned out) to get the 3.40pm train from Chesterfield – due to get me in (via a change in London) at around 7.30pm. However, there were problems between Bedford and Luton, so as soon as I got on the train they told us that we wouldn’t be going to London, we’d be terminating at Bedford. So, off the train goes, we get as far as Derby and then we sit and wait because “We’re sorry but the driver for this train is on a late running earlier train and will be with us shortly”. After about half an hour we get moving again. It turns out that the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2453923.stm">power lines were down between Bedford and Flitwick</a> which is why we couldn’t go beyond Bedford. At Bedford we all pile off the train and queue up for a connecting bus. After a 10 – 15 minute wait, I get on a bus and we make our way to Flitwick (25 mins away). At Flitwick they tell us that they haven’t seen any trains for 45 minutes and so they’ll ferry us on to Luton (35 mins away). We get to Luton, and get on a <a href="http://www.thameslink.co.uk/">Thameslink</a> train which is going to Moorgate (via Kings Cross). The screens at Luton say that there is a shuttle service to Brighton running from Blackfriars. Hmmm…. Eventually we get to Kings Cross, and I decide that going to Victoria is the best option, and in fact as I get off the train that is what they are announcing. So.. a quick trip on the underground and finally a train from Victoria to Brighton getting me into Brighton at 10.10pm. Finally… so, a 7 hours 20 minute journey from leaving the Chesterfield Office and arriving back in Brighton. *Shudder*. No wonder I’m knackered today is there!</p>
