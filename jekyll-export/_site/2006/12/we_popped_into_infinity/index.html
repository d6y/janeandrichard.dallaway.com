<p>We popped into <a href="http://www.infinityfoods.co.uk/">Infinity</a> for some food for the week and decided we were hungry, so figured we’d try some of <a href="http://www.clivespies.co.uk/">Clive’s Pies</a>. And I have to say, they were fab. We went for one Arabian chickpea and one Hungarian – the chickpea one was our favourite, but we’re going to try some of the others soon.</p>
