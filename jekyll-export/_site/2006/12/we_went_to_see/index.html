<p>We went to see <a href="http://www.theambassadors.com/theatreroyal/sp_p349.html">Aladdin</a> at the <a href="http://www.theambassadors.com/theatreroyal/">Theatre Royal</a> the other night after I’d <a href="/2006/12/winning_streak">won tickets</a>. It had been many years since my last panto experience, and many more years since Richard’s last visit, but it was a fun night. 7 year old girls really, really love <a href="http://www.chicomusic.com/">Chico</a> – the one behind us was screaming “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Chico_Time">What time is it?</a>” at the top of her (very shrill) voice. We thought <a href="http://www.toyahwillcox.com/">Toyah</a> was great, although I hadn’t realised quite how short she is. I was surprised at how long the panto lasted, we started off at around 6pm, and didn’t get out until 8.45pm – that seems to be a long time for small children to sit still for, but the majority of them were really well behaved and seemed to be loving it.</p>
