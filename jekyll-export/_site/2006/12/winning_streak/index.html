<p>I’ve been on a bit of a winning streak recently. Firstly, I won tickets to see <a href="http://www.skinet.com/skinet/warrenmiller/0,27203,,00.html">Warren Miller’s Off the Grid</a> at the Marina last week courtesy of <a href="http://www.skisafari.com/">Ski Safari</a> (good film, although it seemed quite long for a ski/snowboard film). Then at the company Christmas raffle I won a £20 HMV voucher, a calendar (which I gave to one of the lads) and some chocolates (which I shared with my team). And today I’ve just heard that I’ve won 2 tickets to see <a href="http://www.theambassadors.com/theatreroyal/sp_p349.html">Aladdin</a> on Friday in the <a href="http://www.volunteering.org.uk/Projects+and+initiatives/volunteeringinhealth/casestudies/middownshospitalradio.htm">Mid Downs Hospital Radio</a> grand prize draw.</p>
