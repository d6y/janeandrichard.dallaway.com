<p>We caught up with some friends the other evening at <a href="http://www.bom-banes.co.uk/">Bom-Bane’s</a> cafe in Kemp Town. Emma had spotted a review of it in <a href="http://kemptownrag.co.uk/">The Kemptown Rag</a> and the <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/whatson/fooddrink/bombanes/">Argus review</a> made it sound so intriguing we just had to try it. We had the 27 chimes table, and had the Christmas set menu – smoked salmon blinis for starters, then beef wellington and finishing with either Christmas pudding or Christmas waffles. They have a great Belgian beer collection – the Blanche de Bruxelles was great, but the Mort Subite was just too sour for me. A great evening catching up with friends in a really unusual but lovely cafe. </p>
