<p>The Argus says a “<a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1045932.0.academics_dont_drink_enough_says_bar_boss.php">bar has cancelled a monthly science event because academics do not drink enough alcohol</a>“. Total nonsense. I’ve never met a sober academic, and the <a href="http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/">Cafe Scientifique</a> bunch are quite the piss heads. I mean all that in the good sense.</p>
