<p>When we visited Rich’s folks in Margate in July we discovered that <a href="http://www.dontstayin.com/members/djmatisse-fontaine">our neice’s other half</a> had a talent for dj-ing. This visit we discovered that he’d started doing the clubs. Last night he was dj-ing at the <a href="http://www.dontstayin.com/uk/margate/punch-judy/2006/dec/09/event-88821">Funk me Good Sunglasses Party</a>. We didn’t think he needed his Aunt and Uncle in Law (nearly) turning up, but it all went off a storm!</p>
