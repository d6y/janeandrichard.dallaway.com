<p>The other day we were lost for a moment in Brighton, driving around a new development</p>

<p>called the <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1000336">New England Quarter</a>. “New England Quarter”…. Ok, nice enough name. </p>

<p>A few days later, I spotted that we also have an Artist Quarter on the beach.</p>

<p>So does this mean there’s a land grab in progress? Quick! Get a sign up and grab your quarter before they’re all gone.</p>
