<p>I was listening to <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/">Andy Budd</a>‘s <a href="http://2005.dconstruct.org/mp3/AndyBudd.mp3">Web 2.0 talk</a> from last years <a href="http://2005.dconstruct.org/">d.construct</a> conference this morning <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/07/bought_myself_an_fm">on my way in to work</a> and followed up on a few of the sites he mentioned as being good examples of Web 2.0.</p>

<p>One of the sites, <a href="http://ononemap.com/">ononemap</a>, looks like it would be a really useful aid to finding a house to buy, especially if you know the area you’re interested in as it overlays the properties for sale on top of <a href="http://maps.google.com/">google maps</a>.</p>
