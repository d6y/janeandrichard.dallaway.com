<p>We had every intention of spending Sunday at <a href="http://www.fruitstock.co.uk/">Fruitstock</a>, but it didn’t happen. We jumped on the train and headed off to see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq-sD_wZZ1M">Heather</a>, and Heather’s pad in SE17, and we thought we’d then go over to Fruitstock. But it turned out there was a festival just down the road from her in Burgess Park. It seemed only right and proper to check it out, so we ended up spending the day at <a href="http://www.carnavaldelpueblo.co.uk">Carnaval del Pueblo</a> (“the largest Latin American event in Europe”). A couple of beers, lots of food and lots of food choice, four stages… yeah, it’s a good good thing.</p>
