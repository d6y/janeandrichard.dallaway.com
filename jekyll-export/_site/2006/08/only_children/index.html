<p>One of the podcasts I regularly listen to is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/">Woman’s Hour</a>, and yesterday’s was about <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/02/2006_35_wed.shtml">Only Children as adults</a> which, as an only child, was interesting for me. I’d never really given much thought to the concept of there being “particular challenges facing only children”, but I guess there are. Thinking about it, I don’t know that many only children, so I guess we’re still rare, although my Mum is an only child too.</p>

<p>Since listening to the podcast I’ve been doing a bit of googling on only children and have found a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/beinganonly/">mailing list</a>, a <a href="http://www.onlychild.com/home.html">magazine</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Only-Child/dp/0285631489/sr=8-1/qid=1157055422/ref=pd_ka_1/026-5059050-1325254?ie=UTF8&amp;s=gateway">book</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.onlychild.icom43.net/program.html">conference</a> mentioned on the podcast. I’d never even though about there being support networks for only children, but I guess there are support networks for everything else 🙂</p>
