<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Navy_Band">US Navy Band</a> have made MP3s sort of available for quite a few <a href="http://www.navyband.navy.mil/anthems/all_countries.htm">national anthems</a>. It’d be super if they were available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">creative commons license</a>, rather than this one: “The music files on this website are intended for official use by Department of Defense and U.S. government offices only. Exceptions to this policy will be considered on a case-by-case basis”. </p>

<p>And some of <a href="http://www.navyband.navy.mil/anthems/bugle_calls.htm">these bugle calls</a> would make cheesy ring tones.</p>
