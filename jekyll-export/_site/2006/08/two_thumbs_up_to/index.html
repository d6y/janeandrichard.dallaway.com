<p>Two thumbs up to <a href="http://davehodg.blogspot.com/">Dave</a> for suggesting we go and listen to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/paulinetaylor">Pauline Taylor</a> at the Western Front. As it turns out we weren’t able to hang around to hear her set, but we did catch <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ferrishome">Ferris</a> (myspace: Other / Folk Rock / Alternative). I look forward to clicking “buy” on their music in iTunes at some point. </p>

<p>So we now know we have a great little <a href="http://www.badgermusic.co.uk/">live music venue</a> two minutes from our front door.</p>
