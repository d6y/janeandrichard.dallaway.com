<p>We had a weekend of food, some new places and one old favourite and as we haven’t done a food blog for quite some time it’s review time…</p>

<p>On Friday evening we had a takeaway from <a href="http://www.noircaribbean.com/">Noir</a> as <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/whatson/fooddrink/noir/">recommended</a> by <a href="http://gastronautuk.blogspot.com/2006/08/noir-caribbean-takeaway-bringing-flava.html">Amanda</a>. We’d spotted this a few weeks ago, although according to the owner Denise they’ve been open since December – 0/10 for observation. We had jamaican jerk chicken, curried mutton with rice and beans and a roti and apart from the fact that it had cooled down quite a bit by the time we walked back home, it was all great and I look forward to trying some other dishes next time.</p>

<p>On Saturday, whilst we had the family visiting we had fish and chips from our favourite chippy, <a href="http://bankersrestaurant.com/">Bankers</a>. We discovered Bankers shortly after <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/ealing2brighton/">moving to Brighton</a> 5 years ago, and apart from the <a href="http://www.rickstein.com/restaurants_steinsfishandchips.htm">Rick Stein place in Padstow</a>, it is some of the best fish and chips I’ve had.</p>

<p>On Sunday, after our family had left our friends Neela and Ste, and their friend Jana came to see us and we headed off to try a new Brazilian BBQ place, Caucau, that has only been open a few weeks. I’ve never eaten Brazilian food before, and to be honest we needed a Brazilian guide as we had no idea what to do with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farofa">farova</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava">cassava</a> flour). The service was good, and they did try and help us out, but sometimes you just need to be shown what to do :-).</p>
