<p>Richard sent me the link to <a href="http://www.mobuzz.com/shows/3048.html">Mobuzz from August 4th</a> and told me to watch the section on the <a href="http://www.popgadget.net/2006/08/icapopener.php">iCapOpener</a> â€“ a new add-on â€“ a bottle opener for the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/shuffle.xml">iPod Shuffle</a>.
