<p>We’ve incorporated <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/">Google Maps</a> into our <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/">travel index page</a>. Every place we’ve been to has a pin in it, and if you click on a pin you’ll get a box displaying the name and date of when we were there, some also have links and photos to our travelogues. What this has shown us is that we need to get south of the equator more often!</p>
