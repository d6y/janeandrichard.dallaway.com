<p>After catching the second half of last year’s <a href="http://www.thisishull.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=197370&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=197368&amp; home=yes&amp;more_nodeId1=136245&amp;contentPK=14458909">The Apprentice</a>, we started watching this series from the beginning and have enjoyed watching the comings and goings. I’m pretty impressed that an ex-pupil of the <a href="http://www.sydneysmith.hull.sch.uk/">senior school</a> I went to, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/apprentice/candidates/michelle.shtml">Michelle</a>, went on to win it and is now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sugar">Alan Sugar</a>‘s Apprentice. An excellent programme.</p>
