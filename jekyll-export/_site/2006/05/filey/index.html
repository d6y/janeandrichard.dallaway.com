<p>Whilst staying with my parents over the weekend we visited <a href="http://www.discoveryorkshirecoast.com/filey_welcome.asp">Filey</a>, a place I hadn’t been to for many years. It was a pretty cold, blustery day but we managed a walk along the sea front and spotted this water feature based on a maritime compass which is part of Filey’s <a href="http://www.discoveryorkshirecoast.com/content/what_to_do/filey/fy_art_and_craft.asp">art and craft scene</a> and which I primarily noticed because of Richard’s obsession with the <a href="http://www.met-office.gov.uk/datafiles/offshore.html">shipping forecast</a>.</p>

<p>No cream teas to <a href="/2006/05/afternoon_tea_and_teashops">review</a>, but I can say that the Rainbow cafe does good bacon sandwiches.</p>
