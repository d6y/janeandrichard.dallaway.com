<p>We played tourist yesterday, and decided to head out for dinner on a Saturday evening. Our first choice, <a href="http://principiagastronomica.com/post/15">Due South</a>, was fully booked so we decided to wander along the seafront and into town. I spotted that Louis Beach cafe had a sign out saying that they now do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_cuisine">Jamaican and Carribean food</a>, so we thought we’d stop by and take a look. One portion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_chicken">Jamaican Jerk chicken</a>, one of ackee and saltfish and a side order of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantain">plantain</a> and we were very happy people. They don’t have an alcohol license, but the <a href="http://ultimatepubguide.com/pubs/info.phtml?pub_id=176">Fortune of War</a> is within staggering distance. We had a great evening, eating tasty food, looking out to sea.</p>
