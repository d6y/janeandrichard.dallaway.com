<p>I was listening to the <a href="http://connectedtraveler.com/">Connected Traveller</a> : <a href="http://connectedtraveler.com/wordpress/?p=121">Travel News/Odds ‘n’ Ends</a> this morning and one of the items was about <a href="http://www.happyplanetindex.org/list.htm">The Happy Planet Index</a> which is an index of human well-being and environmental impact. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a> is pretty low with a HPI (Happy Planet Index) of 40.3. The top of the index is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a> with an HPI of 68.2. The lowest is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> with 16.6 where life expectancy is only 36.9 years.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.itint.co.uk/hpisurvey/">calculate your own HPI</a>. I scored 29.7 which isn’t very good, but seems to be pretty badly affected on ecological footprint which for me is 8.62 global hectares, or the equivalent of 4.79 planets – oops! Most of this is due to my 30 mile each way trip to work, and my flights to the US/Canada for snowboarding. We’re pretty good with recycling, but I need to be better at <a href="http://www.national-student.co.uk/Features/Article%20TURN%20IT%20OFF.htm">turning electrical appliances off rather than leaving them in standby</a>.</p>
