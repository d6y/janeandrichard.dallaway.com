<p>I played my first game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_%28sport%29">squash</a> with <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/Susieleaving2/">Suz</a> <a href="/2002/03/well_played_my_second">over 4 years ago</a> and we played together for about 6 months until she went back to New Zealand to be with the lovely Greg. I didn’t play for another year or so and then found a new squash buddy at work and have played once a week pretty much since October 2003. But no more. I’m forced to hang up my raquet and retire. A couple of weeks ago I started having some pain in my left knee, and my right shoulder, and today after little improvement I went to see the Doctors. The diagnosis is a torn muscle (probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoid_muscle">deltoid</a>) in my shoulder, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_%28injury%29">strained</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprain">sprained</a> ligament in my left knee. The Doctor recommended that I give up squash, and if I don’t give it up I should wear a knee brace.</p>

<p>When I was young I often had knee problems, they would lock when I sat on the floor. I remember going dry slope skiing one time and not being able to walk for a couple of days. When I mentioned this to a previous Doctor I was told to be careful, and if I wanted to go skiing I should buy a knee brace. So, having been warned before I feel it is time to listen. Much as I’ve enjoyed squash, I enjoy snowboading more and after just <a href="/2006/06/ride_kashmir_151">buying a new board</a>, I’m not willing to risk that, and I don’t really get knee pain when snowboarding so I’m planning to continue.</p>

<p>So, I need a new sport that doesn’t involve lots of lateral knee movement. Suggestions from friends at work have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shove_ha%27penny">shove ha’penny</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiddlywinks">tiddlywinks</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards">cards</a>. Anybody got any slightly more active, but pretty low impact for knees suggestions?</p>
