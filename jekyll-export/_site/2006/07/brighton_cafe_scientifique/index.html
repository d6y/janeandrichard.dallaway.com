<p>We went to the last of this season’s <a href="http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/">Cafe Scientifique</a>s at the <a href="http://www.glendola.co.uk/terraces/index.asp">Terraces</a> this evening. Tonight’s discussion was “<a href="http://www.christurney.com/brs_book.html">Bones, Rocks and Stars: the science of when things happened</a>” given by <a href="http://www.christurney.com/">Chris Turney</a>. It was a really interesting talk, with props (inflatable globe, skulls etc) and promoted a really good discussion afterwards. This was the kind of science that I can cope with – some of them can be a bit too technical for me – but I always learn something. Tonight I learnt about the calendar system, and that the western astrological calendar is out of kilter with the constellations by approximately one month (see <a href="http://www.deepermind.com/48Astrology.htm">Astrology vs Astronomy</a> and read the section on Zodiacs in Astrology). Also in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_calendar">Ethiopia it is currently 1998</a></p>

<p>One of the gentlemen we shared a table with was telling us about <a href="http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/">The Royal Society</a> and about their <a href="http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/landing.asp?id=4">discussions</a> which are open to the public. Apparently he went to a very interesting one on climate change a while ago and looking at their website they are have a wide range of topics. Maybe something to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>As we were heading home, Richard pointed out that I could enter into the <a href="http://cultofmac.com/">cult of mac</a> and create an <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/">iCal</a> calendar for the Brighton Cafe Scientifique – so I have and it can be subscribed to at &lt;webcal://ical.janeandrichard.co.uk/BrightonCafeScientifique.ics&gt;</p>
