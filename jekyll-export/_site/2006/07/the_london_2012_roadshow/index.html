<p>The <a href="http://www.london2012.org/en/gettinginvolved/2012+Roadshow/">London 2012 Roadshow</a> is in Brighton tomorrow. </p>

<p>Where: Brighton, Seafront</p>

<p>When: 18:30 to 21:00</p>

<p>What: Cultural and sporting activities </p>

<p>And according to the <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1158804">Council</a> “On 14 July the Roadshow bus will be on the seafront (opposite the Grand Hotel near the basketball court) for a sports and cultural event. There will be basketball, volleyball and hip hop displays for the public to enjoy, starting at 7pm and continuing to 9pm”. Shame we’re going to be at the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383574/">cinema.</a></p>
