<p>We went to see <a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/">An Inconvenient Truth</a> last weekend at the <a href="http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/cinema_home_date.aspx?venueId=doyb">Duke of York’s</a>. Very well put together, with some really eye-opening statistics. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inconvenient_truth/?critic=columns">Other people</a> have reviewed it far better than I could, so I’ll leave it there.</p>

<p>Last year, when we went to the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/cornwall2005/205_0545/">Eden project</a>, you could buy some carbon offset packs to compensate for the amount of miles you drive per year. I thought about it, but didn’t pursue it. This morning I’ve just paid for a <a href="http://www.climatecare.org/index.cfm">carbon offset</a> for the 6.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions I have used driving and flying. I’ve been researching the options primarily between <a href="http://www.climatecare.org/index.cfm">Climate Care</a> and <a href="http://www.carbonneutral.com/">Carbon Neutral</a>. The calculators at Carbon Neutral for flights cover more options, but for driving there seemed little difference between the two.</p>

<p>In the end the choice of supported projects swung it for me. Carbon Neutral have a <a href="http://www.carbonneutral.com/cncalculators/flightsdetsfr.asp">Natural Woodland portfolio</a> (although there weren’t any available for me to buy), an <a href="http://www.carbonneutral.com/cncalculators/flightsdetsintc.asp">International Communities portfolio</a> and a <a href="http://www.carbonneutral.com/cncalculators/flightsdetsfut.asp">Futures portfolio</a>. All which seem pretty worthy. The <a href="http://www.climatecare.org/projects/countries/index.cfm">Climate Care projects</a> seem to be a bit smaller scaled and helping more local communitites, concentrating on efficient cooking stoves, efficient lighting and things like that.</p>

<p>The other thing that concerned me slightly about Carbon Neutral was the fact that you got gifts for having your certificates posted to you – surely this is adding to carbon emissions?</p>

<p>Tomorow we’re going to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489037/">Who Killed the Electric Car?</a> Not sure if the Duke of Yorks is having an eco-season or something, but we seem to be.</p>
