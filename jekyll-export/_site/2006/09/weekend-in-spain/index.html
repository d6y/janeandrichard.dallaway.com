<p>We spent a few days at the lovely <a href="http://www.lacasadelolivar.com/">La Casa Del Olivar</a> with friends Jim and Lucy. La Casa is close to <a href="http://canales.diariosur.es/fijas/pueblos/ingles/villaalgaidasi.htm">Villanueva de Algaidas</a>, and only an hour or so from Malaga airport, so not bad for a weekend trip. </p>

<p>The days were lovely and hot, and so tourism suffered as a lot of time was spent around the pool making up games involving an inflatable dolphin, 3 beach balls and 2 inflatable pillow things. </p>

<p>We did manage a couple of trips and so headed off to <a href="http://www.elrefugiodelburrito.com/">El Refugio del Burrito</a> where Jim was the definite friend of the donkeys, the flamingo lake at <a href="http://www.andalucia.com/province/malaga/fuentepiedra/home.htm">Fuente de Piedra</a> and <a href="http://www.andalucia.com/antequera/home.htm">Antequera</a>, a lovely town dating back to the Bronze Age.</p>
