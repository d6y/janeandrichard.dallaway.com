<p>A weekend of food related stuff. Firstly, on Friday evening we revisited the <a href="http://www.noircaribbean.com/menu.asp">Noir Caribbean</a> takeaway, this time trying the goat curry and chicken curry which we both polished off in no time, all washed down with a bottle of <a href="http://www.englishorganicwine.co.uk/">local organic wine</a>.</p>

<p>On Saturday we pottered around the <a href="http://www.brightonfoodfestival.co.uk/brighton_festival_food_market_2006.php">A Taste of Sussex</a> market, picking up some <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2742/">local food</a>, drinking some <a href="http://www.thebeerstation.co.uk/">local beer</a> and generally chilling out enjoying the sunshine. We headed out to Hove for dinner, but with no real plans, and decided on <a href="http://www.theinsight.co.uk/eatingout_dec.htm#losamigos">Los Amigos</a> for dinner, which was good, but as with our last visit, the bill seemed surprisingly high. Our last stop for the day was <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/31/3137/Sussex/Hove">The Sussex</a> for beers.</p>

<p>Today, Richard had to head off to London, so I decided to continue the food based weekend and, <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/">armed with my camera</a>, I visited a few local food shops, both <a href="http://www.montezumas.co.uk/">tried</a> and <a href="http://www.infinityfoods.co.uk/infinity-retail/index.html">tested</a> and <a href="http://www.sussexandthecity.co.uk/">new to me</a>, before returning to the <a href="http://www.brightonfoodfestival.co.uk/">food festival</a>, to sample some of the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2728/">hot</a> <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2751/">food</a> and also to watch a few of the shows on the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2753/">live</a> <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2752/">food</a> <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2736/">show</a> stage. Then home to cook some <a href="http://www.fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipet.cgi?r=14003">bagels</a>.</p>
