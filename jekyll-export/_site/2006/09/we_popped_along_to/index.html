<p>We popped along to the <a href="http://www.badgermusic.co.uk/">Badger Music</a> night at the Western Front <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/08/two_thumbs_up_to">again</a> on Tuesday and had another fun evening. As we arrived Prince Rodger were just setting up, a 2 piece featuring a cello. The cello and the double bass are two of my favourite instruments, probably because one of the guys I shared a house with at Uni owned both, and the cello lived in our house and some Sunday mornings I’d wake up to the sound of a cello drifting up the stairs. Anyways, the second band were <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ahvb">And His Voice Became</a>, a great 2 piece act from London, featuring a drum kit, a guitar and a <a href="http://www.bossus.com/index.asp?pg=1&amp;tmp=24">loop station</a> used to excellent effect, and very good they were too. The final act were <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thebobbymcgees">The Bobby McGee’s</a> who were, quite simply, mad. But wonderful too, with a drum kit, a double bass and 2 singers armed with ukulele, banjo and a <a href="http://www.melodicas.com/melodicas.htm">melodica</a>. An excellent band to see live.</p>
