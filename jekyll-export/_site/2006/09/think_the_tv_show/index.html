<p>I think the TV show <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory">Who Do You Think You Are?</a> is a perfect example of the BBC meeting their charter <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/charter/pdf/charter_text.shtml">to inform, educate and entertain</a> all in one programme. You’ve got celebrity for the entrainment, information in terms of history, and education in terms of genealogy. And just to reinforce the BBC stamp on it, you’ve got <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/get_started/wdytya_celeb_gallery_04.shtml">Doctor Who</a> turning up in it on 27th September.</p>
