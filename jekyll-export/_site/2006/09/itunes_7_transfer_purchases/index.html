<p>A new feature for <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes 7</a> is the ability to transfer purchased music from an iPod to a desktop – as long as the purchaser of the music is authorised on your machine. I discovered this by accident when I plugged my <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/shuffle.xml">shuffle</a> into my PC at work to put some files on it before heading home for the weekend. When I plugged it in a dialog appeared offering me a new option to “Transfer Purchases”, I figured I’d give it a try and it copied all the purchased music on my shuffle onto my PC. Great. So, I headed off home and decided to plug our main iPod into my macbook and see what happened. No pop up dialog, but if I control click on the name of our iPod I get a menu which offers “Transfer Purchases”. Very cool! This will save me cutting CDs to transfer our purchases from one machine to another.</p>
