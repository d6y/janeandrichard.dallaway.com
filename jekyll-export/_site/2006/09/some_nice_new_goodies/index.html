<p>Some nice new goodies from Apple were <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html">announced on Tuesday</a>, movies via <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/download/">iTunes 7</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodnano/">new look iPod nano</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodshuffle/">new look iPod shuffle</a> (so small….) and the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5339470.stm">iTV</a> unit (yet to be given a proper name). I didn’t watch all of the <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/sep_2006/event/index.html">event broadcast</a> (partially due to the poor audio quality of the presentation, which when combined with the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=macbook+poor+speakers&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">poor speakers in the macbook</a> made it almost impossible to hear over the rain hammering on the roof outside).</p>

<p>I downloaded the new iTunes yesterday and quite a few of the user interface features look nice, although as with all things will take some getting used to. I connected my, sadly out of date now, <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/shuffle.xml">shuffle</a> and looked at the settings tab and found the following at the bottom of the page.</p>
