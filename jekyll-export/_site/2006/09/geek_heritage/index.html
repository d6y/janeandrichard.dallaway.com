<p>Turing, the Enigma, the WWII code breaking efforts… these are all important parts of our geek heritage. So we were unable to resist a visit to <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/">Bletchley Park</a> on a day when they’d invited back veterans who had worked the machinery there, and the team who had re-built and were demonstrating a working version of the Bombe: <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/bletchleypark2006/">Photos are up with a bit more of an explanation</a>. </p>
