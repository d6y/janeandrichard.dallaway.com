<p>I listened to the excellent <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1152.html">IT Conversations: Steve Coast</a> podcast on my way in to work this morning, which was all about <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. This is a project I already knew of from the <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/podcast/">dConstruct podcasts</a> as there was a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Brighton#Brighton_Mapping_Workshop">Brighton mapping workshop</a> the day after dConstruct.</p>

<p>I don’t have a GPS unit, but my only exposure to one was excellent. Whilst in <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/colorado2006/">Colorado</a> snowboarding in March we found out about the <a href="http://www.slopetracker.com/">SlopeTracker</a> service, and rented a unit at Copper Mountain. The end result of this was a piste map with our routes marked on it, along with statistics such as maximum speed, miles travelled, time spent boarding etc (<a href="http://www.slopetracker.com/images/copper_sample(big-web).jpg">sample map</a>). A great service. So today I started investigating what other ski resorts you could get GPS based maps for, and I stumbled across <a href="http://www.mountaindynamics.com/en/index.php">Mountain Dynamics</a> and the <a href="http://www.mountaindynamics.com/en/snowranger.php">SnowRanger</a> set of resort maps. There’s an <a href="http://www.mountaindynamics.com/en/uplinkinfo.php">Uplink</a> tool as well so that you can share your <a href="http://www.mountaindynamics.com/en/tracks.php?shared=1">routes and statistics online</a>.</p>

<p>If we can find a similar service that supports the Mac, then my justification for buying a GPS unit will be in place, and then maybe I can start to contribute to OpenStreetMap as it sounds like a great project. I especially like the fact that they’ve proved the existence of <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Catalog_of_Errors">errors</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Copyright_Easter_Eggs">easter eggs in the traditional maps</a>. I’m not sure why, but I’ve always found the use of fictional roads and landmarks as a way of protecting your copyright to be a bit wrong when your reputation relies on the, otherwise, amazing quality of your data.</p>
