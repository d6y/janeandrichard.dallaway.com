<p>One of the non-spam emails I had waiting for me was about a new Brighton based site <a href="http://greenbrighton.com/index.php">Green Brighton</a> which uses google maps to be a directory of all things green in Brighton – “<em>vegetarian and vegan restaurants, organic veg boxes, recycling centers, permaculture gardens and meditation classes</em>“. Looks like it could become a good resource.</p>
