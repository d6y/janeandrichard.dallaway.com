<p>Last time I <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/05/filey">visited my parents</a> we headed back from Filey via Bridlington, and happened to stumble across the <a href="http://www.bridlington.net/business/bayle/Index2.html">Bayle Gate</a>. My Grandfather was a stonemason by trade, and Dad told me that the Bayle Gate was one of many buildings he’d played a small part in preserving. I wish I knew other things he’d worked on, or what his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason's_mark">mason’s mark</a> was.</p>
