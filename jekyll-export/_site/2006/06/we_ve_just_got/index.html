<p>We’ve just got back from a really pleasant few days break in Prague (of which more later I’m sure). As is now traditional, we had to find a wall chart for the <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/index.html">world cup</a>, and having failed to find one before we left the UK, this years is from the Czech magazine <a href="http://www.hattrick.cz/">HATTRICK</a>. The special World Cup issue also contains team information, and their predictions. So, according to HATTRICK the winners will be <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/team/overview.html?team=arg">Argentina</a>, with the <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/team/overview.html?team=cze">Czech Republic</a> in 2nd place. Third will go to the <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/team/overview.html?team=ned">Netherlands</a> and 4th to <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/team/overview.html?team=bra">Brazil</a>. And what do they say about <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/team/overview.html?team=eng">England</a>? We’ll go out in the 2nd round.</p>
