<p>As we were watching the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991538.stm">Portugal v Holland</a> game we realised that the referee <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/ref/37294_IVANOV_Valentin.html">Valentin Ivanov</a> reminded us of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whose_Line_is_it_Anyway%3F">Whose line is it anyway?</a> contestant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Stiles">Ryan Stiles</a>.
