<p>We booked a 4 night break in Prague through <a href="http://www.lastminute.com">Last Minute</a> and found Prague a great city. Everywhere you turn there are impressive buildings. Every corner you turn there is something to make you stop and think. And the beer is cheap as well ðŸ˜€&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>We used the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904978134/richarddallaway">Time Out Prague</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1845875184/202-2720243-4131820?v=glance&amp;n=266239/richarddallaway/">Prague popout map</a> to find our way around.</p>

<p>We did the usual touristy things, checking out the castle, the Charles Bridge, the old town, the new town. We only visited one museum which was the <a href="http://www.muzeumkomunismu.cz/">Museum of Communism</a> but there were plenty of others we could have seen.</p>

<p>It would be possible to spend a 2 night break in Prague and see most of the sights, we were fortunate enough to be able to take it easy and have a relaxed stay.</p>

<p>We stayed at <a href="http://www.andelshotel.com/content/en/1.php">Andels Hotel</a>, which was out of the centre somewhat, but really well connected by a wide range of transport, and the hotel was lovely with good facilities.</p>

<p>All in all, a great trip and a city well worth a vist.</p>
