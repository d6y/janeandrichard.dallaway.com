<p>Well its not quite a month since I blogged with relief that <a href="/2006/05/glad_to_read_on">Peter Taylor wasn’t joining Charlton</a>, unfortunately he isn’t going to stay at Hull either and is joining <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/5067262.stm">Cystal Palace instead</a> :-(. The only positive is that Hull gets compensation for him going. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Royle">Joe Royle</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Penney">Dave Penney</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Allen">Martin Allen</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Tilson">Steve Tilson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a> are the names currently being lined up with the job.</p>
