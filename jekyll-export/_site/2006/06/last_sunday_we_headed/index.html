<p>Last Sunday we headed out to the <a href="http://www.ridgeview.co.uk/">Ridgeview wine estate</a> near Ditchling to see what tastings they were doing to celebrate <a href="http://www.english-wine-week.com/">English Wine Week</a>. Ridgeview specialise in sparkling wines, so the best comparison from last years vineyard visits was our visit to <a href="/2005/05/to_celebrate_english_wine">Nyetimber</a>. The major difference is that Ridgeview is open to the public 6 days a week for tastings throughout the year, something we may take advantage of next time we have visitors. We tasted the <a href="http://www.ridgeview.co.uk/htmls/som%20memoir%20grosvenor%2001.htm">Grosvenor</a>, the <a href="http://www.ridgeview.co.uk/htmls/som%20memoir%20cavendish%2003.htm">Cavendish</a>, the <a href="http://www.ridgeview.co.uk/htmls/somfitzrovia03.htm">Fitzrovia</a> and their special, limited red, the Pimlico, and left with 4 bottles to enjoy over summer.</p>
