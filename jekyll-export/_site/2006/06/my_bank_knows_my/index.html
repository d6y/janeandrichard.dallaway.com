<p>My bank knows my email address and mobile phone number. It can send me emails, and it can text me — in fact it does both already. So when I go to a cash machine (ATM), why am I offered a printed receipt? Why not just SMS or email me the receipt? There’s no a security issue, because I’ve seen people leave those receipts in the machine or on the floor near the cash point. </p>

<p>If I’m going to be emailed a cash withdrawn receipt, why not attach something to the email I can drag and drop into my financial software. And if the banks could do it, why not the credit card companies for every transaction I make.</p>

<p>Not only would this be useful, we’d also save the 10 kerjillion megakilos of paper used every year by receipt printers.</p>
