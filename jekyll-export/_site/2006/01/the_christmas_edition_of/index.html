<p>The Christmas edition of the Economist ran a feature on <a href="http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5299220">human evolution</a>. I found one of the sections in particular quite interesting: <a href="http://www.cogsci.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/psyc/newpsy?12.008">the suggestion</a> that the brain is like a peacockâ€™s tail. Thatâ€™s to say, itâ€™s a over-the-top demonstration of the ownerâ€™s genetic fitness. Itâ€™s clear that brains are expensive (2% of the body, using 20% of the energy intake) and there are a bunch of things we do which it could be argued donâ€™t help us survive, but might help us mate: dancing, painting, music, language. </p>

<p>The article caused me to remember the book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0586090452/richarddallaway) . One idea in that novel is that brainsâ€”when they get to a certain sizeâ€”are more trouble than theyâ€™re worth. The evidence offered to support this is the fact we spent so much time trying to silence our brains with alcohol ðŸ™‚</p>
