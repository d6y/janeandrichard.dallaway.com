<p>We spent a few days in Les Allues, France over New Year with Jeremy and Kirsty and spent the time snowboarding in <a href="http://www.les3vallees.com/uk/index.php">Les 3 Vallees</a>. We made use of our lift tickets and spent some time in each of the other 2 valleys, but spent most of our time in Meribel and Meribel Mottaret. We were really fortunate and had 2 powder days – New Years Eve and New Years Day – what an amazing way to start a new year.</p>

<p>We spent New Years Eve (and in fact most other evenings) at La Tsaretta in the village.</p>

<p>A great break, and Meribel and the surrounding area is definitely a resort I could return to.</p>
