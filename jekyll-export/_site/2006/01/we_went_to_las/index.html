<p>We went to <a href="http://www.iguanas.co.uk">Las Iguanas</a> on Friday evening for dinner. The cocktails were good (mohitos), the chips and dips were excellent, as was the starter (duck taquitos). Unfortunately, the main courses (chicken moqueca and xinxim) were dissapointing – overcooked chicken with a bland sauce. The atmosphere was pleasant, the wine was tasty and the desserts were pretty good (although £3.50 for a slice of watermelon seemed a bit steep). </p>

<p>Overall, probably worth a visit for their starters/tapas (they do a tapas menu at the bar), but I wouldn’t bother with a main course again.</p>
