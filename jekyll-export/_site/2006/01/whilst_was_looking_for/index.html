<p>Whilst I was looking for webcams of some of the ski areas we’re thinking of visiting, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.snoweye.com/">SnowEye</a> which claims to have over 3000 webcams from ski resorts all over the world. They’re classified by country and region which makes it really easy (providing you know your geography) to get a glimpse of conditions. Now we’ve just got to hope that the webcams don’t show us huge greeny muddy areas like they would have done of <a href="http://www.snoweye.com/?page=ca-bc&amp;detail=fernie">Fernie</a> last year.</p>
