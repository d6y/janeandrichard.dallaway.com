Rapid Transport system will probably be a funky looking New Zealand built electric bus, judging by the pictures at the <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1146307">council web site</a>. Should be good for anyone wanting to get into town without sitting in <a href="http://www.citytransport.org.uk/emerge.html">traffic</a>, but I’m not sure of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4526366.stm">status of the proposal</a> at the moment. </p>

<p>Anyone looking for rat runs through town could turn to page 24 of the original proposal (<a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/downloads/bhcc/transport/rapid_transport_report.pdf">PDF</a>), where you’ll find a map of the areas of peak congestion: </p>
