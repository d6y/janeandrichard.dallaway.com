<p>Congratulations to Julie and Craig on a great party with some lovely people, oh, and also on getting married. A roast for dinner (mmmm) and the band were cracking. Later, when the disco kicked off, being the designated driver, I was able to contemplate the physics of “<a href="http://www.lyricsondemand.com/onehitwonders/itsrainingmenlyrics.html">It’s raining men</a>“, and I conclude it’s messy. Ah-uhuh. </p>

<p>What else… plenty of men in kilts, which was possibly something to do with <a href="http://www.spatial-literacy.org/UCLnames/Map.aspx?name=PATERSON&amp;year=1998&amp;altyear=1881&amp;country=GB&amp;type=name">their surname</a>. Allegedly the best man would show you the contents of his kilt if you asked nicely. How friendly’s that?!</p>
