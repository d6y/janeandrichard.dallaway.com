<p>We had a tough time of it trying to find a restaurant when</p>

<p>Mitül and Ash visited this weekend. All these places we called were full. We couldn’t understand why. One place didn’t have a table for four, but said they did have two tables for two. I think it took <a href="http://www.in-the-spirit.co.uk/cocktails/view_cocktail.php?id=86">a good cocktail</a> to wake us up to the fact it’s the weekend before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day">Valentine’s day</a>…</p>

<p>About the photos: 1) The shop on Western Road only had one large sheep, and didn’t seem too keen to part with it. 2) After Ash and Mitül headed off to the station, we walked into the North Laine where a shop is selling plaster cast wall-mountable over-sized <a href="http://www.aquarterof.co.uk/love-hearts-p-394.html">Love Hearts</a>.</p>
