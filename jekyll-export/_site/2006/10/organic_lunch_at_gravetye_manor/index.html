<p>As part of the <a href="http://www.ashdownforest.com/foodfestival/events.html">Ashdown Forest Food Festival</a>, we headed off to <a href="http://www.gravetyemanor.co.uk/">Gravetye Manor</a> for an 5 course organic lunch accompanied by organic wines.</p>

<p>We arrived slightly early, and so settled down in the lounge. We started with a glass of <a href="http://www.organicwines.co.nz/ourwines.htm#sauv">Richmond Plains, Nelson 2005, New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc</a> served with olives and radishes. This was probably my favourite of the wines, and is the only full glass I had, being the designated driver.</p>

<p>We were called into the <a href="http://www.gravetyemanor.co.uk/images/accom/diningroom.jpg">dining room</a>, and started with an espresso cup full of Cream of organic celeriac soup with italian truffle. This was a really flavoursome soup, and if it wasn’t going to be followed by an additional 4 courses, I could have imagined myself happily eating my way through a large bowl of it.</p>

<p>The next course was Seared fillet of organic salmon served over creamed leeks and tomato butter accompanied by a glass of <a href="http://domainestpaul.twis.info/wine.php?ID=1178&amp;action=setLanguage&amp;LANGUAGE=en">Sauvignon Sur Lie</a> 2005 Domaine St Paul, Vin de Pays d’oc. The salmon was lovely, and the tomato butter was amazing and very rich.</p>

<p>We then moved on to a glass of <a href="http://www.thewinedoctor.com/tastingsprofile/beaucastel.shtml">Coudoulet de Beaucastel</a> 2003 Cotes de Rhones to accompany an amazing 3rd course of Roast Loin of <a href="http://www.ashdownforest.com/details.php?myID=206">Tablehurst farm</a> pork served with fondant potato, Autumn savoy cabbage and apple sauce. The pork was incredibly flavoursome and the gravy was amazing. This wine was Richard’s favourite of the meal.</p>

<p>The penultimate course was Lightly poached pear with vanilla yoghurt ice cream and light San Zemo sabayon accompanied by a glass of San Zeno 2003 Riciota de Soave. The pear was wonderful, the wine was nice, but too sweet for my tastes.</p>

<p>Our final course was a tasting of three organic cheeses, my favorite was the Scottish Criffel which was a ripe semi-soft cows milk cheese. The other two were Perl Wen white rinded cows milk cheese from Wales and Mature Cheddar from Plaw Hatch Farm.</p>

<p>And to finish, coffee (or tea for those of us who don’t do the coffee thing). After this we managed a quick wander around the <a href="http://www.gravetyemanor.co.uk/gardens_spring.htm">grounds</a> before heading back to Brighton.</p>
