<p>Last weekend I was in <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/zurich2006/">Zurich</a> with <a href="http://www.glass.co.uk/uk/en/">work</a>. Lots of partying, a bit of business. We were there with 500+ other EurotaxGlass employees, but I have to confess that I didn’t spend much time with our european colleagues, instead I spent time with some of our Weybridge colleagues that I deal with on a day to day basis, but rarely spend any “out of office” time with. It was a really good weekend, with even a bit of sight-seeing thrown in for good measure amongst the drinking and partying.</p>
