<p>We managed another couple of comedy events as part of the <a href="http://www.brightoncomedyfestival.com/">Brighton Comedy Festival</a>. Last Sunday we saw the excellent <a href="http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/">Ross Noble</a> at the <a href="http://brightondome.org/">Dome</a>. Very funny, and judging from some of the <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/display.var.950128.0.ross_noble_fizzy_logic_brighton_dome_concert_hall_oct_14_and_15.php">reviews</a>, he improvises a lot, changing a lot of his material from show to show. </p>

<p>Last night we saw <a href="http://www.jocaulfield.com/">Jo Caulfield</a> at the Pavillion Theatre. Her show is all about <a href="http://www.jocaulfield.com/angryandannoyed.php">things that make you angry and annoyed</a>, allowing for amusing rants about argos, familes and leaving time to take audience suggestions – a lot of people in Brighton seem to be annoyed by cyclists!! She’d done her research about Brighton, being able to name various landmarks and appreciate the difference between Brighton and Hove (actually!) which is always a good sign. I thought her idea for a range of greetings cards were great – “Congratulations on your marriage, remember the gift I bought you for your first wedding? Good” :-).</p>

<p>Both of these have been “laugh out loud funny” for me. This afternoon we’re off to see <a href="http://brightondome.org/events/eventdetails.asp?id=2098">Paul Merton’s Silent Clowns</a> which includes a full showing of Laurel and Hardy’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019688/">Big Business</a>.</p>
