<p><a href="http://www.twinset.org/graphics/gallery/pic005.jpg">Pete</a> sent me a copy of <a href="http://www.twinset.org/">Twinset</a>‘s debut album <a href="http://www.twinset.org/album1.html">Low Burlesque</a> a few weeks ago. I’ve listened to it on a number of occasions now and I’m quite enjoying it, my current favourite is still <a href="http://www.twinset.org/mp3/Twinset%20-%20Be%20Alone%20Tonight.mp3">Be Alone Tonight</a>. Of course they have a <a href="http://www.myspace.com/twinset">myspace presence</a>, and you can also listen to the album online for free at <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pagemusic.cfm?bandID=597386">soundclick</a></p>
