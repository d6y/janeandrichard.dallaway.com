<p>I blogged over at <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com">jane.dallaway.com</a> about my success at getting the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/booklist.html">booklist</a> <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/2006/10/reading-list-now-running-off-delicious.html">running off del.icio.us tags</a>. This morning I had a bit of a brainwave, and decided to do the same with <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/snow.html">snowboard resorts</a>. So, with the addition of a couple of new <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> tags of “riddenat” and “torideat” I’ve got a list of resorts (and I’ve added country tags too) by country that I’ve been to, and a simple list of ones to visit in our next trip (to <a href="http://www.skiutah.com/">Utah</a>).</p>
