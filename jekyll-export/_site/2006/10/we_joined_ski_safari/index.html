<p>We joined <a href="http://www.skisafari.com/">ski safari</a> at Alfresco’s last night for their <a href="http://www.skisafari.com/news.asp?nID=42">start of Season party</a>. We’ve been on two excellent trips with them, to <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/canada2005/">BC, Canada</a> and to <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/colorado2006/">Colorado</a> over the past couple of years, and so it was good to go and meet the <a href="http://www.skisafari.com/team.asp">people</a> behind the trips. The evening was sponsored by <a href="http://www.skisafari.com/team.asp">Vail Resorts</a>, and so I’ve brought my Vail Resorts pen and Vail Resorts post-its into the office, and we managed to have some tasty canapes and beer too. We discussed our next snowboarding trip ideas with them, and also learnt more about their new offerings – <a href="http://www.skisafari.com/news.asp?nID=44">weekends in Switzerland</a>! At one point Richard was getting advice (and <a href="http://www.saltlake2002.com/main.html">olympic</a> anecdotes) about Utah from <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/special_events/winter_sport/newsid_2527000/2527591.stm">Graham Bell</a> (former British Olympic Skier) which was kind of fun (especially as Richard didn’t realise who he was and wondered why he was so obsessed with the olympics).</p>

<p>After the excitement of looking at ski brochures, trail maps and talking to people about alternative snow trips – like Chile in summer, we headed off to the Black Horse Inn to meet up with the <a href="http://sussex.geekdinner.co.uk/?p=8">Sussex Geek Dinner</a>. We missed <a href="http://www.roddis.org/">Tristan</a>‘s talk about plone, but did get to meet some interesting people. Nice organisation <a href="http://www.harriyott.com/">Simon</a>!.</p>
