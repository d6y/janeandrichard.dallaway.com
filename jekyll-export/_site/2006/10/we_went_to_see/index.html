<p>We went to see <a href="http://www.marcusbrigstocke.com/">Marcus Brigstocke</a>‘s <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/whatson/events/paramountcomedy/display.var.950253.0.review_marcus_brigstocke_corn_exchange_brighton.php">show at the corn Exchange</a> on Monday. A surprisingly flat evening: the performance was fine, there was some good material, but…. <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meh">meh</a>. </p>

<p>Also annoying was one of his ideas for Atheist Airways, which ended with pun of the pilot not saying what the cruising altitude was because he wouldn’t commit to anything. Which is fine, except it’s confusing atheists with agnostics, and even then an agnostic might actually say that the cruising altitude was something that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic">couldn’t be known</a>. You know what… it’s best not to analyze jokes. </p>

<p>For anyone who’s familiar with his rants on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/nowshow.shtml">The Now Show</a>, you’ll know about his problems with BT. So it was fun to see two large BT trucks parked right outside the theater at the end of the show, with some burly engineers standing around, maybe waiting for someone…</p>
