<p>We spent this afternoon at the <a href="http://www.metroskishow.co.uk/2006/">London Metro Ski and Snowboard Show 2006</a> at Kensington Olympia. We didn’t have much to do today, so thought we’d go and take a look at the show. Overall, I’m glad we did. At £14 per adult, it wasn’t the cheapest day out, especially when you add the £12 parking, but we got some great ideas for trips for our next few years. We found out more about snowboarding in <a href="http://www.japantravel.co.uk/index_en.htm">Japan</a> (apparently February is the best time to go as it is the time of the snow festival, and there are lots of ice sculptures and ice caves created), and also <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/10/we_joined_ski_safari">another</a> company (<a href="http://www.dreamskiadventures.com">dreamski</a>) offering guided trips to <a href="http://www.dreamskiadventures.com/whychile.html">Chile</a> and another company offering <a href="http://www.skiweekends.com/">ski weekends</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.metroskishow.co.uk/2006/features/skillsslope.html">Skill Slope</a> did great business today, lots of skiers – no snowboarding today though 🙁</p>

<p>We also found the <a href="http://sportsdo.net/">SportsDo</a> gps system, making use of a java enabled or windows mobile phone using a bluetooth connection to an <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Globalsat-BT338-x-trac-bluetooth-receiver/dp/B00092759S/richarddallaway">external gps unit</a> to record journeys of all kind – drive, walk, run, ski, cycle etc. Sounds like a great idea, now to see if it works!</p>
