<p>We went to the last of our comedy events for the festival yesterday – <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/silent-clowns.shtml">Paul Merton’s Silent Clowns</a>. To be honest, I’d expected more talking about the films, but what we got was three silent films shown in their entirity. </p>

<p>Charlie Chaplin in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0007832/">The Cure</a>, <a href="http://www.laurel-and-hardy.com/">Laurel and Hardy</a> in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019688/">Big Business</a> and Buster Keaton in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015324/">Sherlock Jr</a>. All of these were accompanied by <a href="http://www.neilbrand.com/">Neil Brand</a> whose timing was excellent. A great afternoon of entertainment, and a foray into a genre of films I know very little about not to mention a reminder of just how amused I am by Laurel and Hardy.</p>
