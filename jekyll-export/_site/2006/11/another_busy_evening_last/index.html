<p>Another busy evening last Tuesday, with both a <a href="http://www.cafescientifique.org/brighton.htm">Cafe Scientifique</a> and a <a href="http://sussex.geekdinner.co.uk/">Sussex Geek Dinner</a> to go to. We headed off to Cafe Sci and listened to <a href="http://www.psi.org.uk/people/person.asp?person_id=31">Jim Skea</a> of the <a href="http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/">UK Energy Research Centre</a> talking about UK energy policy – what’s science got to do with it? We stayed for the talk, but moved on before the questions and answers as unfortunately this talk was very similar to one we’d heard earlier in the year. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://sussex.geekdinner.co.uk/?p=9">Sussex Geek Dinner</a> was held in the Black Horse again, and despite a slight mix up with the food (new owners, insufficient details on Simon’s booking) the venue was good. <a href="http://www.harriyott.com/">Simon</a> hosted well, despite his sniffles and a good crowd showed up. It was good to catch up with some <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/">familiar</a> <a href="http://web-tart.co.uk/">faces</a>, as well as to meet some <a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/">new</a> <a href="http://www.builtbydave.co.uk/">ones</a>. As long as Simon keeps organising them in Brighton, I’ll probably keep turning up. </p>

<p>Now to get on and organise a <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/">Brighton Bloggers</a> meetup for January…</p>
