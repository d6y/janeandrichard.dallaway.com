<p>I picked up a copy of the “<a href="http://www.aoh.org.uk/2006/">Brighton Festival of Artists Open Houses</a>” booklet at the weekend. When browsing through it I spotted that <a href="http://www.anagramworks.co.uk/">Jules</a> has got some work being exhibited – at <a href="http://www.aoh.org.uk/2006/Hanover%20Art%20Trail/listings/176_Holland%20Street/">Holland Street</a> and <a href="http://www.aoh.org.uk/2006/Beyond%20the%20Level/listings/56_Art%20Organic/">Art Organic</a>.</p>
