<p>I missed the news that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4911878.stm">Muriel Spark had died</a>. Those with good memories may remember that <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/summerfireworks/img_0449_640/">one of my photographs</a> was used as the cover for <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811215768/richarddallaway">All the Poems of Muriel Spark</a> a couple of years ago.</p>
