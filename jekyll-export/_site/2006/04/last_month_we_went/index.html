<p>Last month we went to see <a href="http://www.juicebrighton.com/terry.html">Terry Garoghan</a>‘s <a href="http://www.terrygaroghan.com/show.html">Brighton The Musical</a>. I saw him perform <em>Worthing</em>, to the tune of <em>Wild Thing</em>, at the Crocodile Comedy club in the early 90s I suppose, but I didn’t realize it had grown it into a full-blown musical. Too many great songs to pick a favourite. I’d call the whole thing quite silly and wonderful, but others say it is “<a href="http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2006/3/27/209236.html">proper unpretentious, working-class humour at its best</a>“. I should go and buy <a href="http://www.terrygaroghan.com/cd2004.html">the</a> <a href="http://www.terrygaroghan.com/cd2000.html">CDs</a> (which will make no sense to anyone who doesn’t know Brighton fairly well).</p>
