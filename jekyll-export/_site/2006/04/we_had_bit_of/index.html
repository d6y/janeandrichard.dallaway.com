<p>We had a bit of a country pub crawl on Saturday night. We started off for dinner at <a href="http://www.theram-inn.com/">The Ram Inn, Firle</a> which was really good â€“ a nice pub, with a lovely atmosphere, <a href="http://www.harveys.org.uk/">good beer</a> and an impressive menu (small, but carefully prepared). We headed off through Glynde, nearly lost a wing mirror to a 4 wheel drive full of paragliders who were too adrenalin filled to drive sensibly on narrow country lanes before arriving at <a href="http://www.cockpub.co.uk/">The Cock Inn, Ringmer</a> for a half of <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/findbeer.asp">Old Ale</a>. We then headed off to the <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/23/23621/Half_Moon_Inn/Plumpton">Half Moon</a> at <a href="http://www.knowhere.co.uk/468_eatdrink.html">Plumpton</a> for a half of <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/weltons-old-cocky/35761/">Old Cocky</a> before finishing off at the <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/12/12936/White_Horse/Ditchling">White Horse in Ditchling</a>. A great evening.</p>
