<p><strong>Colorado 2005</strong></p>

<p>A snowboarding trip in Colorado, 10 nights spent at the lovely <a href="http://www.fourpeaksinn.com/">Four Peaks Inn</a> in <a href="http://breckenridge.snow.com/">Breckenridge</a> staying in the <a href="http://www.fourpeaksinn.com/our_rooms.html">Gold Nugget room</a>. Breckenridge was a great place to base ourselves, with loads of bars and restaurants to chose from. I’d return to Colorado, and to Breckenridge and would definitely spent time on Breckenridge mountain, at A-basin and at Keystone.</p>
