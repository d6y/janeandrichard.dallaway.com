<p>Whilst we were <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/colorado2006/index.html">snowboarding in Colorado</a> recently, we hired some demo kit to see what, if any, a difference it made.</p>

<p>The first board I hired was a <a href="http://www.ridesnowboards.com/boards/board.asp?ProductID=12">Ride Kashmir 151</a> which I loved. I kept my <a href="/2004/04/my_snowboard_bindings_arrived">own bindings</a> as <a href="http://www.breckenridgesports.com/document_display.cfm?document_id=13177">Breckenridge Sports</a> only had standard Burton bindings. The board suited me well, and I found it a lot less shaky on flats. It didn’t take long to adjust to and I had great fun with it.</p>

<p>The second board was a <a href="http://www.salomonsnowboard.com/uk/products/products.asp?id=784107">Salomon Ivy 151</a> with some <a href="http://www.burton.com/eu/gear/products.asp?productID=86">Burton Mission bindings</a>. The girl in <a href="http://www.breezeski.com/index.php">Breeze rentals</a> recommended the Ivy as a great rental board, but didn’t think it would make a good board to buy as they’ve seen a lot of damaged returns. Apparently the Ivy is due for a re-release next year and it might be worth following up on then. The bindings were great and the board felt really responsive.</p>

<p>Looks like I’m in the market for a Ride Kashmir then…</p>
