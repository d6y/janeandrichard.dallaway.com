<p>Today, we headed down to Stanmer Park to join in the <a href="http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/">Dogs Trust</a> fundraising event, the <a href="http://www.waggywalks.org.uk/">Waggy Walk</a>.</p>

<p>We did 2 laps of an approximately 5k walk, very approximate as it turned out as there were short cuts being taken left, right and centre – and the marshalls seemed a bit too cold, wet and grateful to force people to do the full route. We’d parked in one of the car parks in the woods themselves, so between our journey to and from the car park, and the 2 laps of the route, we clocked up 6.83 miles, or around 11km. I tracked the route on my Garmin watch, and it is <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/03-Oct-10-10_38-WaggyWalks.kml">here</a> for all to check and verify.</p>

<p>By the time we’d finished we were rather wet, but Skitters was pretty forgiving as the lovely ladies in the registration tent admired her cute ears and gave her some treats to munch on. A nice nap (for all) when we got home was just what the doctor ordered, and certainly the 4 legged one seems as full of energy as ever and ready to head outside for more adventures.</p>
