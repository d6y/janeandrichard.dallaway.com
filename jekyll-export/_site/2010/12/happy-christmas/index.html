<p>For our <a href="http://uk.moo.com/products/christmas-cards.html">Christmas cards</a> this year we didn’t <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/12/">force the dog to be a model again</a>, but took advantage of opportunities when they arose through the year. So, one of the designs featured Skitters wearing her Christmas collar, taken in the snow of last December</p>

<p>whilst the other was a photograph of a Santa painted on the Bondhi beach graffiti wall which we spotted whilst we were <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/08/2-weeks-in-sydney/">in Sydney</a> last January</p>

<p>We’ve now done our travelling, and delivered all of the presents that need more than a short walk, so can start this relaxing thing that I’ve heard so much about. </p>

<p>Have a wonderful festive season</p>
