<p>Last year, whilst we were preparing to go to the <a href="/2010/02/a-week-in-gower/">Gower peninsular</a> we stocked up on <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk">OS</a> maps, including one for Pembrokeshire. We spent all our time in the Gower, and didn’t use the map at all. So, we thought we’d rectify that and so decided to head there for a visit. We weren’t disappointed.</p>

<p>We found ourself a lovely <a href="http://6quaystreet.co.uk/">house to stay at in Lower Fishguard</a> and spent our week exploring the area, making the most of the mostly dog-friendly beaches, and enjoying the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/5079323328/in/set-72157624812815833/">beautiful view from the balcony</a>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in a blog post a while ago, <a href="/2010/11/traeth-llyfn/">Traeth Llyfn</a>, could be my favourite beach of all time. Other beaches we visited were <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4968697420/in/set-72157624812815833/">Newgale sands</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/5142688835/in/set-72157624812815833/">Porthmelgan</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/5163884717/in/set-72157624812815833/">Abereiddy</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/5163860631/in/set-72157624812815833/">Musselwick</a> – all of which were charming and beautiful in their own way. The <a href="http://www.pcnpa.org.uk/">Pembrokeshire coastal path</a> is well maintained, and well marked, and has some stunning views along the way.</p>

<p>The house was very dog friendly, and the garden was pretty secure too. There was at least one dog friendly pub in Fishguard itself and a few more in <a href="http://www.doggiepubs.org.uk/print/Wales/Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire itself</a>. The kitchen was well stocked (although if there had been 6 or 7 of us, there may not have been enough pots and pans). The bed was incredibly comfortable, and I spent many a happy afternoon in the living room, reading my book and looking out across the harbour.</p>

<p>Pembrokeshire is definitely an area that deserves further exploration, possibly more towards the Southern area.</p>
