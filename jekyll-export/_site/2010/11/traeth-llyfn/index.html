<p>We had a week in Pembrokeshire in September, of which more in another post, and whilst we were there I discovered what I think could be my favourite beach (so far!)</p>

<p>It is called Traeth Llyfn, and is between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porthgain">Porthgain</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abereiddy">Abereiddy</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire_Coast_Path">Pembrokeshire coast path</a>. To access the beach you need to walk, and then descend a set of metal steps (which the dog needed to be carried down due to the gaps being too wide for her paws) and once youâ€™re down there it is a really lovely place to be, and nice and safe for an explorer dog like ours.</p>

<p>We had the beach to ourselves for most of the time we stayed there</p>
