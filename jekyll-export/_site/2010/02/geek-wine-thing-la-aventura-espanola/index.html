<p>On Tuesday evening Richard and I headed off to the Hotel du Vin for our first <a href="http://geekwinething.org.uk/">Geek Wine thing</a> in quite some time. This one was the second of the new format Geek Wine Things, now being organised and orchestrated by Fergus De Wit and James Reina from <a href="http://www.majestic.co.uk/">Majestic Wine</a>.</p>

<p>There were 8 wines for tasting, 4 white and 4 red, made up of 4 classics and 4 bright young things.</p>

<p>It was a great evening, and as when in the <a href="/2010/02/in-hunter-valley/">Hunter Valley</a> recently, I made a series of notes. These are made up of “wine facts” and tasting notes. Some of the more useful are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Spanish wine system is really focussed on the aging process – so Reserva and Gran Reserva have clearly defined meanings on a bottle of Spanish wine. This isn’t the case when these words are applied to many other nations wines</li>
  <li>Good vintages for Rioja are 2001 and 2004</li>
  <li>The younger a red wine, is the more breathing time it is likely to need</li>
  <li>When thinking about wine and food matching, a good hint is to choose the kind of food that is served where the wine is made</li>
  <li>If you buy a Spanish Reserva or Gran Reserva, then you’re probably on to a winner&lt;/ul&gt; </li>
</ul>

<p>Out of the white wines, my favourite was the first we tasted. This was <a href="http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-albarino/product-is-14266">Albariño Martin Codax 2008 Rias Baixas</a>. Albarino wasn’t a wine that I’d knowingly tasted before, and is indigenous to that particular area of Spain. It was described as being a good halfway house between Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay.</p>

<p>Out of the red wines, there were 2 that I really liked. These were <a href="http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-ribiera/product-is-14437">Emilio Moro 2006 Ribera del Duero</a> and Muriel Gran Reserva 1996. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribera_del_Duero">Ribera del Duero</a> is an up and coming wine area, and the Emilio was a lovely drink. The recommendation was to buy two bottles, drink one now and bury one in the bottom of your garden for 3 to 5 years to age further. Apparently <a href="http://www.erobertparker.com/">Robert Parker</a> gave it a score of 92 – which marks it out as being a good buy. The Muriel is ready for drinking now and was a lovely smooth wine. As Richard said, if either of these were served to us we’d be delighted.</p>

<p>Apparently, Majestic are running a promotion on Spanish wines next month, so I’m sure we’ll be heading down there to pick up some of these for our drinking pleasure.</p>
