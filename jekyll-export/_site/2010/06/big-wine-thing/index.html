<p>On Tuesday Richard and I had the pleasure of attending the inaugural <a href="http://geekwinething.org.uk/?p=130">Big Wine Thing</a>. This was an extension of the usual, monthly or thereabouts, <a href="http://www.geekwinething.org.uk/">Geek Wine Thing</a> but instead of purely wine tasting, this was a food and wine matching event. Again held at <a href="http://www.hotelduvin.com/hotels/brighton/hotel-information">Hotel du Vin in Brighton</a>, and this time led by both <a href="http://twitter.com/jamesreina">James</a> and Fergus from <a href="http://www.majestic.co.uk/">Majestic</a> and Pierre, the assistant Somellier.</p>

<p>The evening started with champagne as the participants arrived and settled down ready for an evening of food, wine and education.</p>

<p>Our meal started with a smoked salmon starter served with a lovely, clear, crisp chenin blanc, a Vouvray <a href="http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-Vouvray+Coulée+d!APOSArgent/product-is-05338">Coulée d’Argent 2008</a>. This was a delightful wine, and another wine which will be finding it’s way into our fridge over the next few months (to join the <a href="http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/product-is-14266">albariño</a> and the <a href="http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-La+Toledana+-+Gavi+di+Gavi+2009/product-is-13033">gavi di gavi</a> from the previous tastings). </p>

<p>Our main course (for the carnivores) was lamb with dauphinois potatoes served with a vibrant collection of vegetables and served with a Chilean Syrah ‘Las Kuras’ 2007 Casa Lapostolle. This met with mixed reviews. It certainly smelled wonderful, really powerful, but the flavour didn’t quite live up to the bouquet. </p>

<p>Dessert was the biggest Creme Brulee I’ve ever encountered (and I managed to scoff the lot) served with a pleasantly surprising dessert wine, <a href="http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-Beaumes+de+Venise/product-is-10278">Beaumes de Venise ‘Domaine de Coyeux’ 2004</a>. I say surprising because I’m not a big dessert wine fan, often finding them too cloying and syrupy. But this was clean and youthful and had a lovely smell of lychees and grapes.</p>

<p>We gained three wine facts from the evening:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Syrah and Shiraz are the same grape, just labelled differently</li>
  <li>Many wines are organic but aren’t labelled as such due to the 10% charge that the soil association charge – this was the case for the Chilean red</li>
  <li>Muscat smells of grapes – as evidenced by the Beaumes de Venise</li>
</ol>

<p>All in all another great evening, and certainly an event I’d be keen to participate in again.</p>
