<p>Sitting in the office at lunchtime, we looked out of the window and saw 4 <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chugger">chuggers</a> standing around the end of Bond Street. I was intrigued about the collective noun, so <a href="http://twitter.com/JaneFoth/status/19819776785">tweeted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what’s the collective noun for chuggers? There are 4 of them huddled around a lamp-post at the Bond Street/North Street junction</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got quite a few replies, some via twitter and some via facebook.</p>

<p>Helen suggested:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A pillage of chuggers? An infestation of chuggers? A coven of chuggers?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A campaign of chuggers? A smarm of chuggers? A knifetwist of chuggers?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>which I rather liked, but Dave’s <a href="http://twitter.com/daveph/status/19821434998">offer of</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
