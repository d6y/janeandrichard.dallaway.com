<p>During our time away in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo, we decided to use iPhone apps whenever possible to get by. These are the apps we found useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> – brilliant for keeping light reading to hand.  The pro version is needed unless you can live with just a small number of pages.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> – for travel documents, and entertainment.</li>
  <li>Built-in Maps app – generally filling the cache when we had WiFI and then using the GPS on the 3GS to find our way around.</li>
  <li>The built-in Screen shot (hold iPhone menu button and power button) – great for capturing images of maps  with a route on when you have WiFi but think you might lose the map or directions out of the cache later.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.appigo.com/todo/">Todo</a> – for getting junk out of our heads so we could forget about stuff and enjoy ourselves.</li>
  <li><a href="http://felaur.com/pdf/">FelaurPDF</a> – transport maps which were too large to view on the in-built PDF viewer.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.concentricsky.com/products/iphone/powerplug/">Power Plug</a> – visual reference for the power sockets around the world.</li>
  <li><a href="http://metro.nanika.net/index.php?p=Z">Metro</a> – for finding our way around Hong Kong and Tokyo.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.weatherpro.eu">Weather Pro</a> – use this everyday to plan for the weather.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.currencyapp.com/support/">Currency</a> – handy for converting back to GBP.</li>
  <li>The built-in camera app – obviously, but useful to snap route information to look at later.</li>
  <li>Sydney Travel Guide  from <a href="http://www.fidesreef.com/">Fidesereef</a></li>
  <li>HongKong Travel Guide also from Fidesreef.</li>
  <li>Tokyo Travel Guide from Fidesreef, again.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.zuti.co.uk/">Tokyo Zuti</a> for getting around the train system.</li>
  <li><a href="http://nozomii.com/tokyocool/contact.cfm-menu=4.htm">Tokyo Cool City Guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.funkworks.com.au/products/transit-sydney/">Transit Sydney</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://mobile-streetmaps.com/">Sydney Street Map</a> – offline map with GPS support.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/interactive/mobile-guides.html">Hong Kong 720</a> (useful before we went)</li>
  <li>NHS <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/iphonedrinks.aspx">DrinksTracker</a> – for keeping score.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also had TripIt, Dopplr and TripAdvisor apps, but I don’t think we used them.</p>

<p>We picked up one paper guide: at Sydney airport we did a Loney Planet “print and bind” of a chapter of Tokyo from one of their travel guides.  This was so that I had something to use on the flight to figure out what we were going to do in Tokyo in a limited amount of time.  As a bonus, the guide was bound in an anonymous brown card, making us look less touristy if we needed to refer to it.<figure id="attachment_1584" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></figure></p>
