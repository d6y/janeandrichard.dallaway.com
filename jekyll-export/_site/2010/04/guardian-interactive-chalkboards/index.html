<p>Thanks to <a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2010/04/guardian_interactive_chalkboards_map_and_share_soccer_games.html">Information Aesthetics</a> for pointing me at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chalkboards/">Guardian Interactive Chalkboards</a> on-line application to look at the in-depth analysis of my favourite premier league team. <figure id="attachment_1485" style="width: 627px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></figure></p>

<p>Look, Hull City did have some shots against Burnley the other day, some were even on target. Its just a shame that this is Premier League only, and its unlikely I’ll be able to use it to view Hull City’s stats next year 🙁</p>
