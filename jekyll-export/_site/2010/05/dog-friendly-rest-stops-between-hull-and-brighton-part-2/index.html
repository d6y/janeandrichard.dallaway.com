<p>Last November I <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/11/dog-friendly-rest-stops-between-hull-and-brighton/">blogged</a> about the dog friendliness of a couple of places we stopped on our drive from Brighton to Hull, and back again.</p>

<p>We did the same trip again this Easter, and stopped at 2 completely different places but using a similar strategy to last time – avoiding motorway services.</p>

<p><strong>Elton</strong></p>

<p>On Good Friday we stopped north of Peterborough in the village of Elton and did a <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/02-Apr-10-15_24-EltonNassingtonLoop.kml">7.5km circular walk from Elton to Nassington and back</a>. It was inspired by a walk named <a href="http://www.nenegallery.co.uk/blog/?p=80">Elton to Yarwell and Nassington</a> which I found when looking for <a href="http://www.nenegallery.co.uk/blog/?page_id=114">walks around Peterborough</a>.</p>

<p>It was a very pleasant walk, following along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nene_Way">Nene way</a> for some of the walk. There were no amenities where we parked, but we drove past a pub on entry to the village though I don’t know if it was dog-friendly or not.</p>

<p><strong>Saffron Walden</strong></p>

<p>On Easter Monday we headed down around Cambridgeshire and stopped at the pretty market town of Saffron Walden. We parked at the free long-stay car park near the football ground, and managed a <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/05-Apr-10-16_32-SaffronWalden.kml">5km circular walk</a> following the walk entitled <a href="http://www.chesterford.org.uk/walks_from_saffron_walden/walk4.html">Park and Gardens Walk</a>, again found on the internet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4494796102/" title="Saffron Walden Council Offices by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2731/4494796102_c98c976b07_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Saffron Walden Council Offices" /></a></p>

<p>Another pleasant stroll, combining parkland and town streets. The <a href="http://dms.visitsaffronwalden.gov.uk/thedms.aspx?dms=13&amp;venue=0230384">Bridge End Gardens</a> looked very nice but weren’t dog friendly so we didn’t investigate. The <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/audley-end-house-and-gardens/">Audley End</a> Park area was very pleasant and worth a stroll. We spotted a few pubs, cafes, tea rooms etc during our walk and would hope that at least one of them would be dog friendly, but we didn’t stop and find out.</p>

<p>So, as with last time, 2 very different places and 2 very different walks. The Elton walk was more like our normal hikes around fields and countryside, whilst the Saffron Walden walk was much more town and street based.</p>
