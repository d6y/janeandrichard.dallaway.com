<p>10 years ago, we posted <a href="/2001/03/so_today_we_ve/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Blogger did rock then, but we finally gave up on it about 18 months ago when we finally <a href="/2009/11/tumbleweed/">moved</a> over to <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress</a></p>

<p>We donâ€™t post very much any more, <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.delicious.com/">delicious</a> (or <a href="http://pinboard.in/">pinboard</a>) took our short comments and links to remember, leaving this for mainly travel related goodness.</p>
