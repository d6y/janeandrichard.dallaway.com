<p>Previously on “Jane on the radio”… we’d discovered <a href="/2008/12/jane_on_the_radio/">a recording of Jane’s christening</a>. Now we have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/sets/72157626672315422/">the photos</a> to go with it:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/5698396023/">write-up in Ariel</a>, the BBC internal magazine, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Baby Jane made a name for herself last month when her Christening service was broadcast on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_Humberside">Radio Humberside</a>.  The Christening, at St Nicholas Parish Church, Hull, coincided with the time of Humberside’s regular Sunday morning <em>United Acts of Worship</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It came as a happy surprise when the Vicar told Humberside staff: “We are doing a Christening this morning. Do you mind?” Humberside Station Manager John Cordeaux was delighted. And baby Jane Fothergill was the ideal ‘star’ — well behaved, but making just enough baby noises to make her presence felt.</p>
