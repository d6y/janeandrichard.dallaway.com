<p>Last night we attended the <a href="http://www.banff-uk.com/">Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour UK Edition</a> show in Brighton. We went last year too, and if I get my way will go every year till they stop bringing it back to Brighton. It’s a great opportunity to see a variety of sports films on a large screen with a beer in your hand.</p>

<p>The films they show vary depending on your venue, but we got to see:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#swiss_machine">The Swiss Machine</a> – awesome film, really incredible – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUWBbepsdmY">watch the trailer here</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#wildwater">Wildwater</a> – this went on a bit too long for me, but then I’m not a wildwater fanatic… So, decide for youself after you’ve <a href="http://vimeo.com/12563837">watched the trailer</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#eastern_rises">Eastern Rises</a> – when the lady introducing the video used the phrase “trust me” whilst telling us fly fishing was a great subject for a video I feared the worst, but this was a really well put together and, dare I say, interesting film which was utterly engaging – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheBanffCentre#p/u/9/MkgN76QMa3o">watch the trailer</a></li>
  <li>Follow Me – lovely mountain bike footage – short version of <a href="http://www.anthillfilms.com/content/2009/05/anthill-films-announces-new-movie-follow-me/">this film</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#longest_way">The Longest Way</a> – a fast and furious look at <a href="http://vimeo.com/4636202">photos and occasional video</a> as Christop Reharge walks from Beijing to Germany (well part of the way at least)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#azadi_freedom">Azadi Freedom</a> – part skiing film, part travel documentary about Kashmir, totally absorbing – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em6yEvivOKk">watch trailer</a> (also inline below)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#parking_garage">Parking Garage</a> – a suitably silly way to end the evening</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that Azadi Freedom ended up being my favourite of the evening, so I’ve embedded the trailer here for you to take a look at</p>

<p>This was only the 3rd date on <a href="http://www.banff-uk.com/LOCATIONS-BOOKING(2194534).htm">their tour</a>, so there are still plenty of opportunities for you to go and see some of these films, and I’d recommend it.</p>
