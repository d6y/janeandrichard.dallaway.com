<p>During 2010 I walked 1282 miles in almost 675 hours (that’s 28 days) – there are <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/year2010/">traces for some of them here</a></p>

<p>Almost all of these (with the exception of the first 2 weeks in January when we were in <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/08/2-weeks-in-sydney/">Sydney</a> and <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/08/50-hours-in-tokyo/">Tokyo</a>) were as a result of taking Skitters for a walk. Richard will have done a similar amount – I still do the morning walks, he does the lunchtime/evening walks and we both do the longer, more explorey, weekend walks.</p>

<p>I can’t believe that I spent almost a month of 2010 outside walking</p>
