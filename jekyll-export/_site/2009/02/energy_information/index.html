<p><a href="http://twitter.com/jonoabroad">Jono</a> and then <a href="http://nodestone.com/people/grasuth/">Graeme</a> pointed me at Googleâ€™s <a href="http://www.google.org/powermeter/smarterpower.html">energy information</a> project, which looks very much like something Iâ€™d be interested in. </p>

<p>Specifically I was wondering if it was possible to take the data from something like <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/10/wattson">Wattson</a> and using some heuristics or some kind of Fourier analysis to detect what appliances were consuming electricity. And better still, compare that against whatâ€™s possible and, perhaps in some cases, suggest itâ€™s time to dump that highly inefficient model of refrigerator and replace it with a new one ðŸ™‚ </p>

<p>But anywayâ€¦ I donâ€™t know what Google are doing, but take a look at the graphs they want to produce. They looks useful to me. </p>

<p>Graeme also pointed me at <a href="http://homecamp.pbwiki.com/">HomeCamp</a>: itâ€™s a hack day/unconference, around the theme of energy monitoring.</p>
