<p>Justing thinking: although I’m a MacOS X fanatic, and officially dispassionate with respect to Windows (unofficially I’d use a stronger word), Bill Gates could turn out to be the bigger geek hero in the long run. <em>What?</em> I just mean <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/annual-letter/Pages/2009-annual-letter-introduction.aspx">the stuff he’s doing now</a> has all the promise of turning out to be monumental.</p>

<p>Of course, maybe not enough to undo all suffering his company has caused. Time to go re-watch that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrGruc9iGIU">Gates vs. Jobs video</a>…</p>
