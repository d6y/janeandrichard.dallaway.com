<p>Last weekend we visited my parents in Hull.  Rather than breaking the journey up at Motorway Services we planned in stops at places which had dog-walking potential. So, armed with a road atlas, and an idea that we wanted to stop between Cambridge and Peterborough, we identified and tried a couple of spots which were only just off the route we travel.</p>

<p><strong>Graftham Water</strong></p>

<p>We stopped at <a href="http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/leisure/what-to-see/water-parks/grafham/">Graftham Water</a> on our way up to Hull on Friday afternoon.  From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafham_Water">wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grafham Water (TL 150 680) is a reservoir with a circumference of about 10 miles (16 km). It is located between the villages of Grafham and Perry in the English county of Cambridgeshire (Huntingdonshire District).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We parked in the car park near Perry, paid our £2, made use of the amenities (toilets, cafe etc) and managed a <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/13-Nov-09_14_40_GrafthamWater.kml">reasonable walk</a></p>

<p><strong>Monks Wood</strong></p>

<p>On the return trip we stopped at Monks Wood. From <a href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nnr/1006103.aspx">Natural England</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Monks Wood NNR is one of the best examples of ancient ash-oak woodland in the East Midlands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no car park as such, but there is parking in a layby off the B1090. There are also no amenities. But, there are a couple of marked walks – we followed <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/15-Nov-09_14_07_ButterflyWalkMonksWood.kml">Butterfly</a> amongst all the trees, stopping for a spot of dog distraction training (lots of interesting smells that a certain young dog was fixated by).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4120489062/" title="B1090 by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2703/4120489062_2a288fcc03.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="B1090" /></a></p>

<p>So, 2 very different walks, both much better places to stop than at a Service station. The amenities at Graftham Water were really good but cost us £2 for parking whilst the walk was better at Monks Wood, we got free parking but had to stop at a Little Chef for toilets and cafe.</p>
