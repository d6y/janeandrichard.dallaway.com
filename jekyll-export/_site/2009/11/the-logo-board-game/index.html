<p>We were in <a href="http://www.thetoyshop.com/toyshop/index.jsp?bmUID=1259097722938&amp;bmLocale=en_GB">The Entertainer</a> the other day, looking for a travel based board game (which we didn’t find), when I spotted this:</p>

<p>The game is called <a href="http://www.drumondpark.com/logo/">LOGO</a> and it seems to be a great way to make sure that children aged 12 years and upwards are indoctrinated as consumers. Oh, and should you be interested, it is retailing for £24.99. So, you get to pay to be marketed to. Nice.</p>
