<p>Last birthday I decided to write myself a set of ‚Äúresolutions‚Äù, or more probably intentions for the year in which I was 36.</p>

<p>Those intentions were:</p>

<p>Attend a photography course</p>

<p>Eat organic food when possible</p>

<p>Eat local food when possible</p>

<p>Make the most of my Madgex ILP time</p>

<p>Exercise at least twice a week</p>

<p>Do photography projects</p>

<p>Visit an IFA and do a full financial review</p>

<p>Get a massage once a month</p>

<p>So, 13 months later, and looking back, how did I do?</p>

<p>Attend a photography course ‚Äì yup, I did a weekend <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/creative%20digital%20photography.html">Creative Digital Photography</a> course at Evolution in Brighton</p>

<p>Eat organic food when possible ‚Äì hard to quantify, but most food eaten at home has been organic, or at least local. Eating out and lunchtimes is harder, but fortunately Brighton has a good collection of different eateries.</p>

<p>Eat local food when possible ‚Äì see point 2 above</p>

<p>Make the most of my Madgex <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/ilp.html">ILP</a> time ‚Äì unfortunately, the cost cutting removed this in November, but I did use quite a lot of time to investigate tools and techniques and have also presented on the topics of Photography and Visual Studio Hints and Tips, ran <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/CodingDojo.html">SQL coding dojo</a>s and a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/2008/08/sql-snap.html">SQL Snap</a> session. Most of these have been written up on my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/blog.html">technical(ish) blog</a></p>

<p>Exercise at least twice a week ‚Äì after a slow start, I started <a href="/tag/running/">running</a> in July following the <a href="/tag/c25k/">c25k</a> programme and did well enough with this to take part in a 3.8K race in November raising ¬£625 for the <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/index.php">Alzheimer‚Äôs Society</a>. I kept this up and ran the (very soggy) <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/12/brighton_santa_dash">Santa Dash 5K</a> in December, and had planned to run the Race for Life 10K in July this year. Training was going ok until <a href="/tag/skitters/">Skitters</a> arrived, and now running has been overtaken by dog walking ‚Äì lots of it ‚Äì and I‚Äôm cancelling my place in the Race for life.</p>

<p>Do photography projects ‚Äì to be honest I haven‚Äôt done anything like the number of projects I‚Äôd optimistically hoped for, but I have worked on my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/lego.html">Lego Santa</a> project.</p>

<p>Visit an IFA and do a full financial review ‚Äì after several years of no financial advice both Richard and I sat down with a new IFA and had a full financial health-check. Our new IFA visits us every 3 or so months and keeps us up to date with what is best for our situation. This has been well worth doing.</p>

<p>Get a massage once a month ‚Äì hmm, no, not once a month, but probably every other month. Must try harder</p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt got a list for this year, so maybe it should be something I reserve for even years üôÇ</p>
