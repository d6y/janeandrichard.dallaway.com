<p>On Saturday afternoon <a href="/tag/skitters/">Skitters</a> and I headed down to the walled garden (more properly known as the <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/212005">Rest Garden</a>) to meet up with <a href="http://www.alexandtheweb.com/">Alex</a> and <a href="http://sheepfilms.co.uk/">Dave</a>. Dave had an idea for a <a href="http://sheepfilms.co.uk/category/shortfilms/">short film</a> for which he needed a dog. After a long discussion about her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider_(theater)">rider</a>, Skitters agreed.</p>

<p>The finished film can be seen <a href="http://sheepfilms.co.uk/2009/12/01/1806/">here</a> and is described as </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunate sausage-based arm condition siezed upon by an opportunistic dog</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He sent us through a version when he had just cut Skitters out but hadnâ€™t removed her blue rubber ball, which I have to say I love ðŸ™‚</p>
