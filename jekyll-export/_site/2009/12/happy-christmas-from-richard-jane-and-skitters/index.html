<p>Just a quick pre Christmas post to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>

<p>2009 was the year that we finally got a dog, the lovely <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/tag/skitters/">Skitters</a> joined us 9 months ago from Shoreham <a href="http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/">Dogs Trust</a>. Obviously, we think she’s the cutest dog in the country, and that everyone should own a picture of her. </p>

<p>So, we armed her with a plush santa toy (which miraculously is still in one piece), covered the sofa in a sheet, and I practiced my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2009/11/flash-improve-your-lighting-techniques.html">off-camera flash techniques</a> learnt at my <a href="http://garage-studios.co.uk/">Garage Studios</a> <a href="http://garage-studios.co.uk/courses/flash">Flash</a> course to produce 4 photos that we were happy with. A quick upload to the lovely people at <a href="http://uk.moo.com/en/">Moo</a> and a few days later I collected 75 lovely Christmas cards from the post office. </p>

<p>This photo, the composite, was used as the rear image, with the front showing a full size version of one of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622745622821/">individual photos</a>. So, if you got one of these cards, I hope you liked it, if you didn’t, well, erm, sorry about that…</p>
