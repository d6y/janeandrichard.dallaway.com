<p>A recent, recurrent theme, seems to have been me mentioning that I donâ€™t run much any more. After all, I have a dog to walk and she likes to play with other dogs etc. Well, thatâ€™s all fine in principle, except, well, Iâ€™ve been talked into doing the <a href="http://www.santadash.com/pages/brighton">Brighton Santa Dash</a> again. So, Saturday â€“ thatâ€™s the 12th December â€“ will find me queueing up with a collection of other Dashing Santas and running 5k along the seafront.</p>

<p>There are a collection of other Madgex Santas running, and Alex has kindly set up a <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/BrightonSantaDashers">Just Giving donation page</a> to collect our generous friends contributions. So, go on, head on over, pop a couple of quid into the coffers.</p>

<p>Last year I managed a time of 33:03, this time as Iâ€™ve done a lot less training I expect to be slower. On the plus side, the weather forecast is looking more favourable ðŸ™‚</p>
