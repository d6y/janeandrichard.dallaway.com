<p>Last week was <a href="http://www.brightonscience.com/">Brighton Science Festival</a> and we managed to get to 2 events, although we did attempt a third.</p>

<p>The first one we attempted was the <a href="http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/">Cafe Scientifique</a> <a href="http://www.brightonscience.com/programme/cafe.html">festival special</a> on “The Frog who Croaked Blue: Synesthesia and the Mixing of the Senses”. But we arrived too late and saw <br />

on the door and so had to make do with a glass of wine in Browns instead…</p>

<p>Next up was the <a href="http://www.brightonscience.com/programme/bigspace.html">Big Space Show</a> which consisted of 3 parts. The first was comedienne <a href="http://www.helenkeen.com/">Helen Keen</a> performing her show <a href="http://www.thejohnfleming.com/HelenKeen/rocket.html">It Is Rocket Science</a> which was an amusing and quirky look at space, rockets and science. <br />

Next up was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zarnecki">John Zarnecki</a> talking about Spacecraft I have Known and Loved which was a trip through the various spacecraft that John has worked on, including this one about which he said “I was with this one longer than my ex-wife”  <br />

The final speaker of the evening was ex-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer_Royal">Astronomer Royal</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Wolfendale">Sir Arnold Wolfendale</a>, on The Origins of the Universe who showed us around various galaxies  <br />

All in all, a great evening of learning. </p>

<p>The last event we attended was <a href="http://www.brightonscience.com/programme/bss.html">Big Science Saturday</a>, a day of science talks and demonstrations.</p>

<p>Our first talk was The Science of Superheroes, a humourous and entertaining look into how the superheroes superpowers could be replicated in the real world. The most amazing of which, at least for me, was invisibility.</p>

<p>Next was Dr <a href="http://www.harrywitchel.com/">Harry Witchel</a> on The Secret Language of Negotiation which was an interesting introduction to tells and signs with some video footage to back these things up.</p>

<p>Final talk of the day was <a href="http://www.badscience.net/about-dr-ben-goldacre/">Ben Goldacre</a> who allowed the audience to choose which talk he should do in a “choose your own adventure” style. He was fascinating, passionate and knowledgeable and we’ve since bought a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Science-Ben-Goldacre/dp/0007240198/?tag=bs0b-21">his book</a> to peruse in our own time. Highlights for me were the formulas of “how to <insert verb="" here=""> a perfect <insert noun="" here="">&#8221; taken from the [Daily Mail](http://flickr.com/photos/janed/3318252239/in/set-72157614526851095/), the [BBC](http://flickr.com/photos/janed/3318253009/in/set-72157614526851095/) and the [Daily Telegraph](http://flickr.com/photos/janed/3319080054/in/set-72157614526851095/)</insert></insert></p>

<p>If my teachers at school, or at least one in particular, had shown as much passion for his subject as the speakers did I might have managed to leave school with a science qualification. As it was, my Physics teacher announced on the first day of our GCSE course that “as far as I’m concerned women are only here to give pleasure to me and give birth to my children and I don’t see why I should teach you physics” which I’m sure you’ll agree is a great start to a 2 year course and something that affected my relationship with science. These type of events are a great way for me to reconnect.</p>
