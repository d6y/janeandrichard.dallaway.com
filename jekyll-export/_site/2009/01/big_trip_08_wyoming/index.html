<p>This was the fifth and final place we stayed on our <a href="/tag/bigtrip08/">BigTrip</a>.</p>

<p>The drive from Big Sky to Jackson took us past the incredible <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yell/">Yellowstone National Park</a> – if our drive had been shorter, and it hadn’t been snowing, we’d have popped in to the park to take a look – maybe next time! Our accommodation in Jackson was at the <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g60491-d248257-Reviews-Elk_Country_Inn-Jackson_Wyoming.html">Elk Country Inn</a>, a reasonably well equipped log cabin within an easy, if cold (-20 deg C) walk of the many restaurants and shops.</p>

<p>Our first stop was <a href="http://www.jacksonhole.com/">Jackson Hole</a>, a resort we’ve heard a lot about, but which we found somewhat disappointing. Yes, it was steep, but that was about it. No tree runs like we’d found at Moonlight, it was busy – even when it snowed it got tracked out really quickly, and I think we’d been totally spoilt by Montana. But we still had fun on our 2 days, and celebrated Richard’s 40th birthday there.</p>

<p>The next day we headed off to <a href="http://www.grandtarghee.com/">Grand Targhee</a>, in deep, fresh, powder, with really limited visibility. I wasn’t feeling great, and so we only managed a half day, but we had some great fun playing amongst the trees with almost no idea what runs we were on, and where we were heading for. After a day off for me to attempt a recovery, we returned to Grand Targhee, on a day when we could see and managed a couple of runs before I had to retire ill. It was a very different experience the second day, and we realised that Grand Targhee isn’t a very big hill, but it gets a huge amount of snow.</p>

<p>Wyoming was a bit of a disappointment – we’d expected Jackson to be amazing – it was the last stop on our trip because we wanted to improve so we were good enough to appreciate it based on it’s reputation. Maybe we didn’t reach a high enough level, or maybe we peaked at Montana and learnt more about what makes the perfect snowboard resort for us, but Wyoming wasn’t the amazing final stop we’d planned.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/user/profile.do?u=janedallaway">my sportstracker log</a> in Wyoming we did: </p>

<ul>
  <li>2nd Mar – Jackson Hole – 23.64</li>
  <li>3rd Mar – Jackson Hole – 23.61</li>
  <li>4th Mar – Grand Targhee – 11.43</li>
  <li>6th Mar – Grand Targhee – 5.55 – a token gesture as I wasn’t well, but couldn’t leave without a return to Targhee</li>
</ul>

<p>A total for Wyoming of 64.23 miles.</p>
