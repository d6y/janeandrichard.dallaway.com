<p>I was just about to write a blog post about our week in Les Arcs last week, when I realised we’d never blogged about last years <a href="/tag/bigtrip08/">Big Trip</a>. So here it is, better late than never. I’ve created 5 blog posts, one for each of the 5 different states we visited as this blog post was getting way too long, so follow the links in the list below to find out more about each state.</p>

<p>Last February Richard and I headed off on an adventure, a month in the US/Canada, mainly based at or near snowboarding/ski resorts. We decided to fly as far West as we needed to, and head back inland over the course of a month. We’d <a href="/2007/08/more_snowboarding_news">started planning</a> by buying a map of the US, and attaching post-it notes to the cities with <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=/maps/Airports_of_the_NW.kmz">airports</a>, and working out where we could get to by plane. We sat down and consulted the internet, and copies of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/World-Snowboard-Guide-Steve-Dowle/dp/0954801423/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1231595787&amp;sr=1-1">World Snowboard Guide</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ski-Snowboard-America-2009-Canada/dp/0915009889">Ski Snowboard America</a> to find a shortlist of resorts to aim for and then started plugging together a month’s worth of flights, car hire and accommodation.</p>

<p>The states we visited over that month were: </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/2009/01/big_trip_08_oregon">Oregon</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2009/01/big_trip_08_british_columbia">British Columbia</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2009/01/big_trip_08_idaho">Idaho</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2009/01/big_trip_08_montana">Montana</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2009/01/big_trip_08_wyoming">Wyoming</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a whole heap of <a href="/maps/">GPS traces</a> from our various snow days, and by my reckoning (with a bit of help from my <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4366035">Nokia 6110 Navigator</a> and <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com">Sportstracker</a>) we covered 506.09 miles on lifts and boards over 21 days on the slopes at 11 different resorts. We also ended up with a lot of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/collections/72157604236171483/">photos</a> and a <a href="http://d6y.blip.tv/#789998">couple</a> of <a href="http://d6y.blip.tv/#789988">videos</a>.</p>

<p>A great, great time, and something I’d love to repeat when I’ve saved up some more pennies.</p>
