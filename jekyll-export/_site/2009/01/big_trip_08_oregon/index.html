<p>This was the first place we stayed on our <a href="/tag/bigtrip08/">BigTrip</a></p>

<p>We’d done a lot of internet research on Oregon, and spent quite a lot of time looking for a log cabin to stay in. Eventually we found <a href="http://www.mthoodwedding.com/">Pappy’s cabin</a>, in Welches, and we based ourselves there for a week.</p>

<p>The cabin is on the banks of the river, and is down what is little more than a dirt track so was totally peaceful and a great place to relax. It is a short drive to 3 ski resorts—<a href="http://www.timberlinelodge.com/">Timberline</a>, <a href="http://www.skihood.com/">Mount Hood Meadows</a> and <a href="http://www.skibowl.com/">Mount Hood Skibowl</a>—and we visited them all during our week, as well as having a day off to investigate nearby Portland. It was lovely coming back each night to a well equipped cabin with a cozy wood-burning stove. </p>

<p>We even had fresh snow on our first day.</p>

<p>Our favourite resorts were Timberline and Mount Hood Skibowl: Timberline, as its name suggests, has lots of trees and I love snowboarding through tree runs, and Skibowl has night skiing, lots and lots of it and snowboarding at night in fresh snow was great fun.</p>

<p>A great week, and a place I’d love to return to sometime.</p>
