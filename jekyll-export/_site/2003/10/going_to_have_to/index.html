<p>I’m going to have to stop posting photos of the <a href="http://www.brightonbears.com/">Brighton Bears</a> until I get a zoom on the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/p800.xml">camera phone</a>…you can’t see anything really. But we were at a game with <a href="http://www.nigelgordijk.co.uk">Nigel &amp; Cheryl</a>, I had the phone with me, so I took photos. <a href="http://www.brightonbears.com/fixtures/fixture_details.asp?fix_id=87">Brighton won</a>, which is the main thing 🙂</p>
