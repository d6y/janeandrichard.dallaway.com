<p>Jane found <a href="http://www.slimp3.com">SLIMP3</a>, which is a little bit of hardware and some open source software that plays MP3s from our server through our home stereo. It’s great, and we’re not the only ones <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2002/12/11/slimp3.html">to think so</a>. I had to add an <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000088UJR/richarddallaway">ethernet to wireless bridge</a> to stream the music wirelessly, but that worked perfectly too. I’m happy.</p>
