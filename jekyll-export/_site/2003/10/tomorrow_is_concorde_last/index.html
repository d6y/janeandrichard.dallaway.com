<p>Tomorrow is <a href="http://www.concorde-jet.com/">Concorde’s last flight</a>. I think this is a shame, as <strong>a)</strong> it was (and still is) a great technological achievement, and <strong>b)</strong> I haven’t flown on it. We were talking about this at work today, and I remembered that I’ve stood on a Concorde, and looked in the cockpit, and sat in one of the seats, but I haven’t flown on it. After leaving uni I worked for Speedwing Logica for a few years, and when we had a day trip to the office before starting work we were taken around Heathrow and shown around a newly kitted out 747 and a Concorde. My memories of Concorde are that it was very small, the cockpit was very low tech in comparison to the fly-by-wire 747.</p>
