<p>I’m working on a new database project at the moment which is dealing with a lot of number manipulations. To make sure we can test all the stored procedures/functions I started writing some test harness code. Then I did a quick google, and thanks to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/posts/22537.aspx#30969">Robert Hurlbut’s .Net Blog</a> I found a <a href="http://tsqlunit.sourceforge.net/index.html">TSQL Unit Testing Framework</a>. My first 2 test procedures did what I expected – yay!</p>
