<p>I made it along to the <a href="http://www.bhcc-online.co.uk/">Camera Club</a> tonight and am very glad I did. Tonights guest speaker was <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/contacts/page/0,7646,329662,00.html">Greg Whitmore</a>, the picture editor for <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/">The Observer</a>. He showed us some of the recent photographs that he’s commissioned for the <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/foodmonthly/">Food Monthly</a> magazine, and then some of the more recent news pictures. This sparked off a long and very interesting debate about all manner of news photography subjects, a lot of which related to the shock tactics used by some papers/photographers, and which turned the evening into the liveliest meeting I’ve been to so far.</p>
