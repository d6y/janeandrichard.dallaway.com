<p>After going to <a href="http://www.bhcc-online.co.uk/">Camera Club</a> last night and seeing some of the photos people have produced using home printers rather than the dark room or the printing services from people like <a href="http://www.pixology.com/consumers/consumerinformationfr.asp">pixology</a> I’ve decided it’s time to look into getting one myself. My first stop is the <a href="http://www.yourprint.canon-europe.com/index.html">Canon website where you can upload an image</a>, and they’ll print it out on the printer you’re interested in. I’ve chosen <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_02_09/148_4823/">this image</a> as I seem to recall that images with greens in can be tricky to produce.</p>
