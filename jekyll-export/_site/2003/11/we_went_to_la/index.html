<p>We went to <a href="http://www.lafourchette.co.uk/">La Fourchette</a> last night for the first time since it’s moved. The food was as good as ever, although the blackboard full of fish/seafood choices has been replaced with a printed menu with slightly less choices. The service was excellent, and the atmosphere pleasant although it was a bit cramped (a couple too many tables). All in all, we’ll go back… again!</p>
