<p>Well, the non-event of the Festival so far was <a href="http://www.theglowproject.com/">The Glow Project</a>. This sounded like a cool, very Brighton event so on Saturday evening we collected a couple of friends and wandered down Kensington Place. And found nothing, absolutely no art of any kind. Lots of people were milling around, but there was nothing to be seen.</p>

<p>So today I emailed them to find out what happened and got this reply</p>

<p><em>Due to unforseen circumstances I had to return to France and postpone the Glow Event until October 2003. Life can be unpredictable! Sorry for the inconvenience, the Glow Project will be back if the sky doesnâ€™t fall on my head this time. Check the local press and hope to see you there.</em> <br />
So at least we know what happened to it.</p>
