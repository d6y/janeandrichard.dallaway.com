<p>We went to our last “planned” Festival event last night, it was <a href="http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/index.asp?id=465">The Complete Lost Works of Samuel Beckett as found in an envelope (partially burned) in a dustbin in Paris labelled ‘never to be performed. Never. Ever. EVER! Or I’ll sue! I’LL SUE FROM THE GRAVE!!!’</a> at Komedia. This was what I would class as Fringe theatre, although it was part of the main festival. I enjoyed it, but it wasn’t quite as polished as some of the other performances we’ve seen. That said there were some great bits in it, and it really is quite silly in places. I think starting it at 9.30pm was a great idea as it gave us chance to get some beers in before hand which I think helped… after all, they expect an element of audience participation!</p>
