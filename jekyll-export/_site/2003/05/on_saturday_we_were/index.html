<p>On Saturday we were at <a href="http://www.artsoutheast.co.uk/press_releases/dontlookback.cfm?state=internal">Don’t look back</a>, which was a non-tour of <a href="http://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/stanmer_park_history.htm">Stanmer Park</a> with the theme of <a href="http://www.hipark.austin.isd.tenet.edu/mythology/orpheus.html">Orpheus and Eurydice</a>. So think death, think opening doors and seeing brides running away from you, think lots of stuff involving rivers. It was a non-tour because you were left to explore the crumbling house, and stumble across the various “sleepers” (actors) who were scattered around.</p>

<p>We had no idea what to expect, and it turned out to be a lovely, but slightly baffling, thing.</p>
