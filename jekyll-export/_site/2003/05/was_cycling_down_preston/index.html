<p>I was cycling down Preston Street this morning, when this huge blue American truck started driving towards me. Now, I only know of one person who drives a truck like this in Brighton, <a href="http://www.danish-boxing.dk/boxers/chris-eubank.htm">Chris Eubank</a>. And it was him. No time for a photo, I was too busy getting out of the way!</p>
