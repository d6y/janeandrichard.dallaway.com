<p>Yesterday we were in a packed house at the Pavilion Theatre to listen to <a href="http://www.hencoup.com/Heather.htm">Heather Couper</a> and <a href="http://www.hencoup.com/Nigel.htm">Nigel Henbest</a> talk about <a href="http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/index.asp?id=551">The Red Planet</a>.</p>

<p>The talk was a kind of summary of their book, [</p>

<p>Mars: The Inside Story of the Red Planet](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747235430/richarddallaway), and it was entertaining and interesting, as I’m sure the book is. Three things stood out: 1. Heather Couper’s praise of Brighton, and the North Laine in particular, as cool place and a cross of San Francisco and Sydney; 2. Heather’s feelings for why people need to go to Mars (lots of emotions there); 3. They believe <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/07/20/viking.anniversary/">life has already been found on Mars</a>. </p>

<p>Regarding life, the interesting question becomes: is the life on Earth and Mars based on the same kind of carbon? If it is, then maybe there’s a common origin. But if it’s not, then life developed independently so maybe there’s life everywhere out there.</p>
