<p><a href="http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/">Brighton Festival</a> started today, and the first event was the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_05_03/">Childrenâ€™s Parade</a>. Lots of local schools all decide on themes and make figures and things and parade through Brighton and onto the seafront. It was a really windy day, so some of the larger objects being carried were a bit unruly.</p>
