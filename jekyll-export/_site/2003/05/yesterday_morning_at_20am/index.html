<p>Yesterday morning, at 4.20am I stumbled out of bed to try and catch a glimpse of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3033225.stm">Lunar Eclipse</a>. I got dressed, grabbed my camera and headed off out of the house to the bottom of the street, and saw nothing except a road sweeper out doing an early sweep of Brighton’s streets. And whilst I was out doing this, Richard was sleeping. If I’d headed off down to the seafront, my chances of seeing something would probably have been higher, but it was too early in the morning for me to go on any such adventures… or even thing straight.</p>

<p>Someone who did manage to see it created a time lapsed image of it <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~cowboypoetwannabe/images/combined-med.jpg">here</a>. (mind you, he’s in Arizona and so it was a far more reasonable hour over there).</p>
