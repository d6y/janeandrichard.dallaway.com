<p>I keep forgetting to check the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/">BBC Radio 4 Comedy</a> site. They have some great stuff to listen to. Right now I’m listening to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/rams/tue1130.ram">Laughing at Dingoes</a>, which is Mark Little’s documentary on Australian humour. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/ross_global.shtml">Ross Noble goes Global</a> is something else I like, too. There’s lots of stuff there, but you need to check weekly because many of the programmes don’t get archived, presumable because the BBC want to sell them on tape and CD.</p>
