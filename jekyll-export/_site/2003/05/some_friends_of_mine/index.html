<p>Some friends of mine are about to embark on an <a href="http://bigtrip_plan.blogspot.com/">adventure</a>. They’re leaving the UK for good, and are cycling their way from Stockton, UK (where Banz is from) to Brisbane, Australia (where Vic is from). From what I remember, they’re planning for it to take a year or so. Good look guys, I’ll enjoying reading about your <a href="http://bigtrip.blogspot.com/">progress</a>.</p>
