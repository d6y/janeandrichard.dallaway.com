<p>Over the weekend I ordered some more memory cards for my camera. I originally wanted a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0303/03030217smartdiskflashtrax.asp">SmartDisk Flash Trax</a> but I couldn’t really afford the £399 price tag. So, I opted for some more memory cards instead. I’m very impressed with the service I got. I ordered 3 cards on Sunday afternoon, an 1GB IBM Microdrive from <a href="http://www.jetmedia.co.uk/">JetMedia</a> and 2 256 MB SanDisk cards from <a href="http://www.widget.co.uk/asp/default.asp">Widget</a>. Both of my orders arrived today so I’m pretty impressed.</p>
