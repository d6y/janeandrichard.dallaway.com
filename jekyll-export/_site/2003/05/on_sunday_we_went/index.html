<p>On Sunday we went to see <a href="http://www.openix.com/~danb/nevsky.htm">Александр Невский</a> (also known as <a href="http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/index.asp?id=471">Aleksandr Nevsky</a>). It’s a 1938 Russian propaganda film about <a href="http://www.cnit.uniyar.ac.ru/yaros/wwe00048.htm">a prince</a> who leads the Russians against all sorts of Bad People, and in this case it was shown with <a href="http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/">the Philharmonia Orchestra</a> supplying the music and the <a href="http://www.bfc.org.uk/">Brighton festival Chorus</a> singing in Russian (I think).</p>

<p>Sounds mad; was wonderful. Lots of funny moments. The battle on the ice could have been cut by 20 mins IMHO, as that part didn’t have me “on the edge of my seat” as was advertised.</p>
