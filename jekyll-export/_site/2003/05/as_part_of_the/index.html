<p>As part of the Streets of Brighton section of the <a href="http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/">Festival</a>, we went to 2 of the free events last Thursday evening. The first was <a href="http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/index.asp?id=563">The Constant Soldier</a>, and the second was <a href="http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/index.asp?id=546">Sister Sister</a>. </p>

<p>”</p>

<p>The Constant Soldier was a bit beyond us, as we didn’t know the original Andersen story but it seemed to be quite well thought out, although I thought that the turn out was a bit poor.</p>

<p>Sister Sister was really well put together, and very enjoyable (although very hard to take photos of as they didn’t stand still very often). It was a mixture of trapeze, video installation and anarchic circus and a decent crowd turned up to support them.</p>
