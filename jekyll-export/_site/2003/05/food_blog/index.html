<p>On Friday evening we decided to treat ourselves to a meal out, and so after a quick look through the <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/books/reviews/rich/juicy.xml">Juicy Guide</a> we decided to give <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/seafood/fruitdemer.html">Fruit de Mer</a> a try. So we called and booked a table and headed off in the rain. Unfortunately they forgot to tell us that they’d changed their name to “Niche”. Still, we found them eventually, and sat for a G&amp;T in their very relaxing bar area (which you can now visit just for drinks) before going upstairs to our table, or any table, we were the only people there. All in all the experience was a good one, and we’ll be going back, both for food and just to use their bar area.</p>

<p>In comparison, yesterday we went to <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/international/curve2.html">Curve</a> for lunch and were really dissapointed. The food was good, but the service was appaling, really poor indeed.</p>

<p>But it got better, and last night we headed to <a href="http://www.elmexicano.co.uk/">El Mexicano</a> for a snack, well, actually we went there because we’d walked passed earlier and seen someone drinking Margaritas which left us with a Margarita craving :-). And the Margaritas were very good indeed, and our snack of Sopes was really good too. I think we’ll be heading back next time our Margarita cravings get too much for us.</p>
