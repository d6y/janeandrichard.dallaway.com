<p>As I <a href="/2003/05/as_cycled_to_work">mentioned the other day</a>, the 3rd round of the British Kitesurfing Championships is being held a mile or so up the road. I’ve just put a report up over at <a href="http://www.igloolife.com/travel/article.php?ArticleID=21">Igloo Life</a> and will probably have some more pictures to share soon.</p>

<p>Update: there are now some <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_05_23/">photos</a> up.</p>
