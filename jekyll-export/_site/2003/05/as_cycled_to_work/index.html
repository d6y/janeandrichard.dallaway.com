<p>As I cycled to work this morning, they were starting to setup for the third round of the British Kite Surfing Championships. It gets underway today, and continues until Sunday (although Sunday is an all amateur day). The itinerary can be found at <a href="http://www.boostsports.com/">Boost Sports</a>. Iâ€™m hoping to get down there tomorrow to watch the proceedings.</p>
