<p>I’ve just had to post my <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/CanonG3.xml">Canon G3</a> off for repair. There’s a little plastic tab on the cover for the CF slot which presses down and allows power to flow to the camera. Without the tab it doesn’t work. I know, mine just broke. :-(. Jessops (who we bought it from) told me it could take 4 -5 weeks to repair, so we rang Canon who said 10 – 15 working days. So we’ve sent it straight to Canon using the helpful people at <a href="http://www.mbeuk.ws/">Mailboxes etc</a> on Western Road, Brighton.</p>
