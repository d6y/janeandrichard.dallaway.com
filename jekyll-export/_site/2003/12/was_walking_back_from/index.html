<p>I was walking back from a meeting the other day, possibly along <a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?X=530750&amp;Y=104500&amp;scale=5000&amp;coordsys=gb">St Nicholas Road</a> in Brighton, and</p>

<p>a fair number of the houses had gone to the trouble to turn their front windows</p>

<p>into a Christmas scene. No idea if it’s organized or spontaneous, a one-off or annual, but it</p>

<p>a fun to stumble upon these things. Hmm… St Nicholas Rd/<a href="http://www.stnicholascenter.org/Brix?pageID=23">Saint Nicholas</a>… it all makes sense, assuming</p>

<p>I’ve got the street name right. </p>
