<p>Well, most presents are bought, and most cards are written. The food shopping is being ordered tonight, so we’re almost ready! I finish at work on Thursday evening, and am off until the 2nd January so get a lovely long time off.</p>

<p>It was the company Christmas meal, at the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/main.jhtml?xml=/travel/2000/01/22/ethote22.xml">Middle House in Mayfield</a>, on Friday evening, which was really pleasant – quite sensible (i.e. not on a sinking boat like Aspect’s Christmas party of 1999!!!), good food, lots of booze (although I was driving) and a good mixture of people.</p>
