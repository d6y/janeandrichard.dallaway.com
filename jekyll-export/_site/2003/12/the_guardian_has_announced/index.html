<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian</a> has announced it’s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/weblogs/story/0,14024,1108883,00.html">Best Blogs for 2003</a>, and the photography based ones are very strong, I can see me adding the winner, <a href="http://www.nyclondon.com/blog/">nyclondon.com</a>, to my favourites.</p>

<p><em>“Black and white also featured in the winner of the best use of photography category. This went to Rob Gardiner and <a href="http://www.nyclondon.com/blog/">nyclondon.com</a> for the stunning quality of his photography. We also commended two others in this category: <a href="http://elephants.brinkster.net/">Camerantics</a>, which also featured among the judges’ selections in the best design category, and <a href="http://www.apparentlynothing.com/">Apparently Nothing</a> – both full of arresting images and enough to make the average aspirant snapper (like me) sick with envy.”</em></p>
