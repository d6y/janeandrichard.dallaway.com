<p>I’d estimate that so far <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> has saved me about £100 in call costs this month. That’s not quite true: I probably wouldn’t have made the calls, if I had to continue to pay BTs rates for calls to Australia. Skype just works and right now is free, but (there’s always a downside) it’s Windows only.</p>
