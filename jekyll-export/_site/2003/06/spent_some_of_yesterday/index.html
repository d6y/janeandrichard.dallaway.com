<p>I spent some of yesterday at the <a href="https://raq2.globaleffect.net/cgi-bin/start.cgi/files/instore/initialise.html?workdetail=zvmad">In-store Design and Marketing show</a> at Earls Court, which was, er, very quiet. The <a href="http://www.fluidnetwork.com">product Iâ€™ve been working on</a> for the last 18 months was being demonstrated as part of <a href="http://www.augustusmartin.com/">Augustin Martin</a>â€˜s product porfolio and so I went along to have a look around the rest of the show as well as to get an idea of the reception. I had chats with a few interesting companies, and they all said the same thing â€“ the turnout was dissapointing. In fact, a lot of them were happy to chat to me (a techy and not a retail marketer) just to pass some time. Still, it was a day out of the office and a chance to collect some more promotional pens ðŸ™‚</p>
