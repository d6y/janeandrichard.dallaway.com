<p>Yesterday we were at the <a href="http://www.ukbeachsoccer.com/">Beach Soccer</a> stadium which</p>

<p>has been temporarily built in Brighton for the <a href="http://62.204.33.220/kc/kc.html">Kronenbourg Cup</a></p>

<p>with the help of <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/archive/2002/06/03/SPORT50ZM.html">400 tonnes of sand</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.beachsoccer.com/index2.asp?main=rules.htm">The rules</a> are different from the football we’re used to, in that there are three periods of 12 minutes, a blue card which sends players to the sin bin and there must always be a winner, via extra time or penalties. </p>

<p>We saw Italy v. Portugal and France v. England (and yes, Eric Cantona was there for the game).</p>

<p>Entertaining stuff, and I’d certainly go see it again.</p>

<p>I don’t know what this shark was doing there.</p>
