<p>My new lenses for my <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/CanonG3.xml">G3</a> arrived today. I’ve bought a 2x telephoto lens (Kenko KNT 20) and a 0.72x wideangle lens (Raynox DCR 720), as well as a couple of Kenko lens adapters from <a href="http://www.2filter.com/">The Filter Connection</a>. Shame I <a href="/2003/05/ve_just_had_to">haven’t got a G3</a> to put them on at the moment :-(, but hopefully it will be back at the end of the week.</p>
