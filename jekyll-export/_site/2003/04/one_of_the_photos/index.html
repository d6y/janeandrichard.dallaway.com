<p>One of the photos I took of the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_03_28/">West Pier fire</a> is on the BBC web site as part of their “<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/2780295.stm#">Taken a good picture lately?</a>” set for the week of <a href="javascript: void window.open('http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/03/uk_your_perspective_on_the_world0_29_march_-_4_april_2003/html/1.stm'," title="1049374707', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=400,left=312,top=100">29 March – 4 April</a>;). Take a look at it <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/03/uk_your_perspective_on_the_world0_29_march_-_4_april_2003/html/2.stm">here</a>.
