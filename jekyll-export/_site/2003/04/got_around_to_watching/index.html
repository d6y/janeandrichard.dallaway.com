<p>I got around to watching a programme that <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml">Tivo</a> had recorded for us a month or so ago about <a href="http://www.lomography.com/">Lomography</a>. It was really interesting, and I especially like the <a href="http://www.lomography.com/content/about/rules/dbl.php?wr=01">Rules</a> for photography. No 1: Take your camera everywhere you go. Last time I did this was with my <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/eyemodule.xml">eyemodule</a> [<a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/eyemodule/">photos</a>]. Hmm, sometimes I wonder whether I should have 2 sets of camera equipment, one for “shoots” and one just to carry around with me. or maybe I should just invest in a <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/p800.xml">camera phone like Richard</a>‘s?</p>

<p>I’m especially taken with the <a href="http://shop.lomography.com/orbiz/DigiTrade/e519fdf1b3fa05ec021e303d5233c11c4a26fa4e98ae2703ab1b8b92d46e254c/supersampler/super_frame.html">supersampler</a> <a href="http://archive.lomography.com/archive/mysqlworldarchive/index4.php?i=0&amp;name=&amp;hometown=&amp;i_shot_state=&amp;i_shot_town=&amp;i_title=&amp;i_shot_content=&amp;i_shot_country_id=&amp;i_shot_kategory_id=&amp;i_shot_color_id=&amp;i_cam_id=5&amp;submit=Search">shots</a> as this is a really interesting concept.</p>
