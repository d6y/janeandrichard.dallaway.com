<p>Last night I went to our <a href="http://www.photoclub.fsnet.co.uk/">local camera club</a> for the first time. I had been thinking about going for a while, but didn’t think I was good enough and felt embarassed by my efforts. Over the weekend we popped along to their exhibition at the <a href="http://www.gardnerarts.co.uk/">Gardner Arts Centre</a> and I realised that they had a wide cross-section of styles and talents, and that I wasn’t far behind some of them and so could probably learn by association.</p>

<p>Last night was a slide show by a Father and Son team. <a href="http://www.paulreynolds.com/">Paul</a>, the son, did a show on his different styles of photography and some were very impressive especially <a href="http://www.paulreynolds.com/gallery/12.htm">this</a>. Father, <a href="http://www.rogerreynoldsfrps.com/">Roger</a>, did a show based on photos he took during a trip to <a href="http://www.photoventures.net/gallery/patagonia/images.htm">Patagonia</a> – some very impressive icebergs and glaciers. I have much to learn.</p>

<p>The club has a lot of, how do I put this politely?, older members, but the people I spoke to were all very nice and chatty, so I’ll probably go again.</p>
