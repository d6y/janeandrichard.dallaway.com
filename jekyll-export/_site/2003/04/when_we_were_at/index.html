<p>When we were at my folks house at the weekend I collected a couple of old cameras to play with. One is a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jgpyke/baldixette.htm">Baldawerk Baldixette</a> and the other is a <a href="http://www.ozcamera.com/photo 9/902.jpg">Coronet Conway Popular Box Camera</a>. I’ve tracked down some reasonably priced film from <a href="http://www.7dayshop.com/catalog/default.php">7dayshop</a> and so I guess I’ll be experimenting with film and digital over summer.</p>
