<p>Congratulations to Karl. He ran the marathon in 5hrs 26 minutes yesterday. He says he’s got some really lovely blisters to show for his day, and can hardly walk. But he did it. Well done! You can still sponsor him <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/karlhoods/">here</a> and help the <a href="http://www.lunguk.org/">British Lung Foundation</a>. There’s a photo of him with his medal <a href="http://www.actionphoto.net/gallery/gallery_lrg.asp?pg=1&amp;race=16&amp;rcnam=Flora+London+Marathon&amp;rcn=41405">here</a>.</p>
