<p>We spent Easter weekend in Hull visiting my parents, and managed to fit in quite a lot – a Hull City match (we won!), some touristy stuff as well as setting Dad up with a new PC. As usual I took heaps of photos, so I’ll get around to processing them sometime soon. </p>

<p>Update: The photos are now up <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/easter2003/">here</a>.</p>
