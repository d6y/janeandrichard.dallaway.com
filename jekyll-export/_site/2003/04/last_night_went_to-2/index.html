<p>Last night I went to the <a href="http://www.photoclub.fsnet.co.uk/">camera club</a> <a href="/2003/04/last_night_went_to">again</a>, and again it was interesting. It was a competition, with an outside judge, <a href="http://www.touchingthelight.dial.pipex.com/features/jean2002.htm">Jean Holmwood</a>. The categories were “creative” as well as open sections for the Intermediate and Advanced groups. The creative slides included some that had been obviously digitally manipulated, and then created as a slide. At least one of these was manipulated, and displayed to full screen and then photographed with slide film (he hadn’t noticed that one of the photoshop icons was on the image – that was a bit of a giveaway really :-). It got me to thinking of other ways you could do this. Then I came home and started reading a magazine I’d bought the other day “<a href="http://www.dphotographer.co.uk/">Digital Photographer</a>” for “enthusiasts and Pros”. On the letters page is a letter asking just that, how to get a digital file onto slide. The answer appears to be that there is a firm based in Nottingham, <a href="http://www.procolour.co.uk">Viva Imaging</a> that will do that, and if you look for photo labs in your area, check them for “digital film recorder” services. So, at least I know that when I feel confident enough to submit images to these slide competitions, at least I will be able to do so.</p>
