<p>My <a href="http://www.dallaway.com/sloppy/">Sloppy</a> project has a write-up in <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/">PC-Pro</a> magazine, issue 104 (June 2003, cover headline: “Can you ditch Microsoft”). Jump to page 207/208. One day you might see it in the <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/realworld/realworld_index.php">Real world</a> section of the magainze’s web site. But not for a month or so, I’d guess.</p>
