<p>It was my birthday yesterday, and I had a very nice day indeed thank you. Richard bought me lots of photography toys (a new tripod, and a couple of books [<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/071531274X/richarddallaway">1</a>],[<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0817437126/richarddallaway">2</a>]) which will keep me out of mischief, and I got some lovely presents from other friends and family.</p>

<p>We went out for dinner at the <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/seafood/regency.html">Regency Restaurant</a>, which was pretty good, although <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/french/la_fourchette.html">La Fourchette</a> is still my favourite seafood restaurant. We then headed off to meet Jeremy for a drink at the <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/at_the_bar/threejollybutchers.html">3JB</a>s, probably the last time I’ll ever go there as their customer service was appaling – we ordered glasses of wine, which tasted like vinegar to us, and they then refused to replace them. All in all a good birthday (although less surprises than <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622634902371/">last year</a> :-).</p>
