<p>We went round to see Paul and Tess’s new house last night, and very lovely it is too. We were in no rush, and they had no other plans, so we ordered a takeaway curry and sat and had a very lovely meal. Now we don’t order takeaway food very often as we often find the quality suffers, but the <a href="http://www.brightonandhove.cc/Nishat%20Tandoori%20(menu).htm">Nishat Tandoori</a> had some lovely dishes (it does Goan and Indian so there were a few interesting variations). And what is even better, is that it’s only a couple of streets away from our house. Smashing.</p>
