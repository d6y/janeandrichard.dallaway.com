<p>We were in London last night attending an <a href="http://www.ecademy.com">ecademy</a> event. The event wasn’t great, but it was good to meet up with some friends. On the way home we noticed the above sign for a play: <a href="http://www.themadnessofgeorgedubya.org/">The Madness of George Dubya</a>. You can’t quite make it out, but on the far left it says “re-written daily”. No idea what the show’s like, but nice title.</p>
