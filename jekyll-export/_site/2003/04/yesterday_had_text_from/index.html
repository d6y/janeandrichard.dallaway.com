<p>Yesterday I had a text from <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/surprise/img_1699_640/">Heather</a> saying that she was going to be appearing in Hove Crown Court (she’s a barrister) and were we around for a coffee. I was and so after she’d done her barrister stuff, Heather and I met up for a coffee, and then we toddled off to Lucy’s for lunch (where Richard joined us) and then we decided to head to the <a href="http://www.grandbrighton.co.uk/">Grand</a> for a bottle of champagne before Heather had to head off back to London. One of those “it just happened” kind of afternoons. Lovely.</p>
