<p>On Friday we headed out to see <a href="http://www.good-bye-lenin.de/">Good bye, Lenin!</a>. A <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0301357">fine and funny film</a>, if you can handle subtitles or speak German, about the fiction a son has to create to keep the <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,967896,00.html">fall of the Berlin Wall</a> from his mother. I hadn’t been to the <a href="http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/site/cinemas/Brighton/local.htm">Duke of York’s</a> cinema for about 10 years, but I’ll be back there: the screen felt small (we were at the back of the balcony), but any cinema that’s licensed and sells cake is on to a winning combination in my books.</p>

<p>Afterwards we needed tasty, quick, cheap food in an uncrowded place. I thought we’d maybe get two out of those four on a Friday night, but we found them all in one go at Bombay Aloo. It’s an all-you-can-eat Indian vegetarian buffet. Like other people we’ve walked past it a few times and wondered what it’s like: it’s definitely worth trying. I’d eat there again without a second thought.</p>
