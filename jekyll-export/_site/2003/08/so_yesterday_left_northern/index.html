<p>So yesterday I left <a href="http://www.northern-atlas.com">Northern Atlas</a>. Jeremy and I went in, collected the remainder of our belongings and then went, with Duncan, to <a href="http://www.woodiesdiner.com/">Woodies Diner</a> for a lovely, lardy lunch.</p>

<p>In the evening Richard and I met up with Jeremy and Kirsty and we headed down to Santa Fe for some 2 for 1 happy hour cocktails to start us off. The guys sitting next to us were obviously out on a mission to get drunk as fast as possible, and were drinking some weird concoctions (sambuca, creme de menthe, baileys with a shot of tequilla on the side). We got chatting to them, and all of a sudden they were going to buy us tequilla as well. We all turned it down, well, apart from Jeremy that is… who had a shot with them, and then of course had to return the favour and have another shot – this time of Bacardi 151. We made a quick getaway, whilst he could still stand, and had dinner at the <a href="http://www.itchybrighton.co.uk/venues/651.html">Boardwalk</a> before finishing the evening playing arcade games on the pier.</p>
