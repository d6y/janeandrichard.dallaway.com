<p>The <a href="http://www.kensington.com/html/3720.html">Kensington Wifi Finder</a> looks like an interesting gadget. It’s a wifi finder so you can just look at the lights to see if there’s a wifi connection where you are – without having to get the laptop out. Sounds cool… now I just need a laptop that is luggable…</p>
