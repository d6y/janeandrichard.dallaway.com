<p>Iâ€™ve just been looking around the internet searching for somewhere selling <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068OVR/richarddallaway">The West Wing Series 1</a> cheaper than <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon</a>, and I stumbled across <a href="http://www.priceclash.co.uk/">Priceclash</a> who do comparison shopping for DVDs, videos, CDs and games but who seem to cover far more stores than Kelkoo or any of the other alternatives. One to bookmark I think.</p>
