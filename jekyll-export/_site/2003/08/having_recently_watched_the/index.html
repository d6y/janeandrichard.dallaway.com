<p>Having recently watched the last (in the series?) of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/tv/adam_and_joe.shtml">Adam &amp; Joe Go Tokyo</a>, I’ve come to the conclusion that there should be much more Adam and Joe on TV. Mind you, I said pretty much the same thing for <a href="http://www.leeandherring.com/">Lee and Herring</a>…</p>

<p>Sure, <a href="http://www.shinyshelf.co.uk/article/3/st/652">not everyone liked it</a> compared to Adam and Joe’s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2003/02/17/2505.shtml">other shows</a>, but it worked for me. I’ve had a couple of happy seconds playing <a href="http://www.andrewandkathleen.com/200305.html">Gets!</a> (or Get’s), and I’ll be shopping for <a href="http://www.surla.co.uk/bands.asp?band=psb">Plus-Tech Squeeze Box</a>.</p>
