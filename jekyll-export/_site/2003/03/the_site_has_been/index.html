<p>The site has been slow lately, and now we know why…</p>

<p>I’m part of a web co-op: we all chip-in to pay for the up-keep of a couple of machines on the web. This site is running on one of the machines. Another of the many sites on the machine is <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com">audioscrobbler.com</a>, which has been causing all sorts of problems. I didn’t know anything about it until I read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4618663,00.html">a story in the Guardian</a> today. Interesting stuff, and you’ll be happy to know it’s being re-worked to not kill our machines, and will probably be moved somewhere else soon.</p>
