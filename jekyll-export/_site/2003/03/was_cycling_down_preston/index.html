<p>I was cycling down Preston Street this morning and was wondering how come it was so foggy at the bottom of the street and clear at the top. As I got closer I realised it wasn’t fog, it was smoke. And it was really nasty, smelly smoke too. Once I’d got across the traffic lights, and into the clear air again I had a look back and could see a little red mini (old style) on fire. There was one policeman there with it, and as I turned and cycled away I could hear the sirens as the fire brigade came to the rescue.</p>
