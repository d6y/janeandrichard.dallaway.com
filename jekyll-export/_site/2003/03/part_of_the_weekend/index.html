<p>Part of the weekend was handed over to painting wood and messing with lighting in the house. There’s something quite special when you unscrew a ceiling lighting fixture expecting to find three wires only to discover ten. Mmm.. I just love our <a href="http://www.electrical-installations-rewiring.co.uk/change-light-fitting.html">British wiring standards</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, today I was in our <a href="http://www.brightonchurchillsquare.co.uk/">local shopping centre</a> looking for a few bits a pieces and there was a lovely dog running around – friendly thing, dashing up to people and sniffing and being all curious the way dogs are. Then I found this sign: “POLICE – DRUG DOG TRAINING”. And I thought s/he was being friendly, not frisking me. Still, they’d probably make great pets when they retire.</p>
