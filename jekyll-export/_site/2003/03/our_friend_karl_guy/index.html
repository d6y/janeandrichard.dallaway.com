<p>Our friend Karl (guy in the middle of <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/surprise/img_1701_640/">this photo</a>) is going to run the London Marathon in April this year. He’s running in aid of the <a href="http://www.lunguk.org/">British Lung Foundation</a> and is trying to raise £1,500, so if that’s a cause you want to support then sponsor him <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/karlhoods/">here</a>.</p>
