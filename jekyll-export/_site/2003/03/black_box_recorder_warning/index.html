<p><a href="http://www.indian.co.uk/artists/bbr/">Black box recorder</a> (warning: site auto-plays music. duh) have a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008BXH3/richarddallaway">new album</a> out, which is ever-so good. My copy came from <a href="http://www.cd-wow.com/">cdwow</a>.</p>

<p>Alas, we couldn’t get to see them when they <a href="http://bluefiremusic.tripod.com/id49.htm">came to Brighton</a> (warning: annoying popups. bah) earlier this month.</p>

<p>We’ve also been listening to <a href="http://www.electricsoftparade.com/">The Electric Soft Parade</a>, and recently found out they’re local after watching “Brighton Beats” (6 parts series on ITV, Thursdays 23:30).</p>
