<p>Mandy and Chris visited us over the weekend and took us out of town to the Yew Tree Inn (“Nr Polegate, Sussex, 01323 870590”). It’s a pub that serves top food… too much top food, but I couldn’t stop myself eating it. Aside from food they also serve <a href="http://www.briansbelly.com/beerbelly/caffreysirishale.shtml">my current favourite beer</a>. The tables are maybe a bit too close together, but apart from that, it gets both (yes, both) thumbs up.</p>

<p>Of course, we’ll never find it again as it’s in the <a href="http://www.multimap.co.uk/map/browse.cgi?client=print&amp;X=550000&amp;Y=110000&amp;gride=554432&amp;gridn=107427&amp;scale=200000&amp;coordsys=gb&amp;addr1=&amp;addr2=&amp;addr3=&amp;pc=BN266RX&amp;place=">middle of nowhere</a>.</p>
