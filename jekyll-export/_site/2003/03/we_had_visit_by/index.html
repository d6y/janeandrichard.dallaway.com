<p>We had a visit by the police at work yesterday in relation to an <a href="http://www.thisisbrighton.co.uk/brighton__hove/archive/2003/03/10/NEWS210ZM.html">attack</a> that happened on Friday night/Saturday morning just outside. It was routine questioning – “were you in the office between midnight on Friday and 5.30am on Saturday” – wonder if they’ll find anyone who was. The guy who was attacked sometimes works as the cook in the cafe in the <a href="http://www.maritimehouse.com/">office</a> and so is someone that we all recognise.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good reason, if I needed one, to make sure that I’ve left the office before it gets dark.</p>
