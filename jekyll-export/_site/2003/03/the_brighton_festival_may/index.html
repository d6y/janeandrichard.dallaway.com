<p>The <a href="http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk">Brighton Festival</a> (May 3 – May 25) programme dropped through our letter-box today. There’s nothing much that’s leaping out at me. Depressing. There’s “A Seaside Album” photo exhibition of pictures from 1840s to 1990s, which might be good. Lou Reed is down, which is probably something we should go and see. But apart from that…well, maybe if I read the text a little more I’ll find some good stuff.</p>

<p>There’s also the <a href="http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/">Brighton Festival Fringe</a> and <a href="http://fringe.brighton.co.uk/">Brighton Fringe Festival</a>, neither of which I’ve looked at in any detail yet.</p>

<p>In related news, this year we’re going to help out with the web site for the <a href="http://www.virtualfestival.org.uk/">Virtual Festival</a>. More on that another time, because I think I’ve gone over my allowance for the word “Festival” today.</p>
