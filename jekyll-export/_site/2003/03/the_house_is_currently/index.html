<p>The house is currently under siege. Seems there was a cat trapped in the bin cupboard (trash or refuse area) outside the house. And now it’s out and it’s pretty angry, or maybe distressed. No-one really wants to get too close to it to find out for sure. </p>

<p>What are you supposed to do in these situations? The <a href="http://www.rspca.org.uk">RSPCA web site</a> isn’t terribly helpful, so I gave them a call and they more-or-less said “forget it, but call us if you think it’s really really hurt”. So, my plan is to forget about it.</p>
