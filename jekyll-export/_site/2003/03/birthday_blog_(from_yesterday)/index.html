<p>Yesterday was my birthday (huzzah) and I have many exciting things to blog about, but for now here’s the summary.</p>

<p>I have a stack of Raymond Carver short stories to read,</p>

<p>I now have a nice looking chunk of <a href="http://www.dgm2.com/m/iwanto/b.asp?A=14589&amp;I=2385&amp;c=http://www.iwantoneofthose.com/life.asp?st=00236">moon</a>, Jane found <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005LDFS/qid=1046760518/richarddallaway">Ripping Yarns</a> on DVD and also found me a very cool retro-looking <a href="http://www.aiptek.com/products/digital/dv.htm">mini DV recorder</a> (need to find another photo, because it doesn’t look like that). </p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://www.dgm2.com/m/firebox/b_fb.asp?A=1458&amp;I=41&amp;c=product.php?pid=402">This</a> is what mine looks like</p>

<p>If that wasn’t “woohoo!” enough, we went out to see Brighton Bears win <a href="http://www.brightonbears.com/fixtures/fixture_details.asp?fix_id=43">107-92</a> against the Newcastle Eagles. I won’t post up any of the video we took during the game because I need to spend more time learning how to use the DV recorder…</p>

<p>This isn’t going to sound right, but one of the interval “fun things” is the Duck Chuck: people buy ducks and throw them onto the court, and if they land in just the right places prizes are won. Just imagine sitting down, not quite knowing what’s going on, and then 200 small plastic ducks flying through the air onto the court. It leaves a lasting impression, trust me.</p>

<p>We ate at</p>

<p>Picasso as part of our quest for find the very best pizza in Brighton. What we found was Pizza for £3 and a lot of students. It was fine default pizza, better than many other places with the obvious benefit of being amazingly cheap. We’ll be back there, but our quest for the very best in pizza continues…</p>
