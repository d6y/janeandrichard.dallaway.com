<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon</a> were selling two models of HP Ipaq at a ridiculously low price this morning (the Ipaq H1910 was selling for £7.32 and the Ipaq H5450 was selling for £23.04). The story has been picked up by the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2864461.stm">BBC</a> and by <a href="http://theregister.co.uk/content/54/29820.html">The Register</a>. I ordered one of each, and received my confirmation email. The history of other such mistakes doesn’t make it likely that they’ll honour it. Shame 🙁</p>
