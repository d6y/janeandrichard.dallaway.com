<p>We had a lovely weekend in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622634774565/">Stratford and Warwick</a>. We stayed at the Swan’s Nest Hotel which was one of the <a href="http://www.macdonaldhotels.co.uk/">MacDonald hotels</a> covered in the recent 2 for 1 deal which Sainsbury’s have been running. The hotel was good, but I think overall I would have been a little dissapointed if I’d paid full price for it (the service wasn’t that great). The food in the restaurant was pretty good though both for breakfast and for our Saturday evening dinner.</p>

<p>I hadn’t been to Stratford since I was at school when we went to see Macbeth at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. Unfortunately the <a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/">RSC</a> weren’t “at home” and so we didn’t get to go and see a play. I was surprised by how busy everything was, even on a wet Saturday in March and I’m glad that we didn’t decide to go during summer.</p>

<p>Having explored Stratford on Saturday we decided to head off to <a href="http://www.warwick-castle.co.uk">Warwick Castle</a> on Sunday and spent the day exploring (and taking photographs) there.</p>

<p>All in all a great weekend, it just finished too soon.</p>
