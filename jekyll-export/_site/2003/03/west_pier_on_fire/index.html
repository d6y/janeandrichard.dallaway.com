<p>Perfect day for a fire: a week or more of dry, warm, weather and a good breeze to fan the fames. The West (“other”, “old”) pier caught fire just before 10am this morning. We stood around and watched as the blaze grew and bits of the pier fell in on itself. These are the photos taken with <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/p800.xml">my phone</a>.</p>

<p>In that last photo I was suprised by a helicopter landing on the beach. The photo is actually of it taking off again, but they are big things and make quite an impressive noise up close.</p>

<p>I’m guessing the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/southerncounties/webcams/westpier_main.shtml">West Pier web cam</a> is going to be a popular link today. The <a href="http://www.thisisbrighton.co.uk/brighton__hove/news_features/west_pier_fire/">local news</a> is reporting things like “strong suspicions this was the work of an arsonist” and also that the “West Pier rebuild ‘will go ahead’”.</p>
