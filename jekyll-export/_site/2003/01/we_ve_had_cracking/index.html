<p>We’ve had a cracking weekend. A bit of light shopping yesterday afternoon and then off into London (well, Elephant and Castle to be exact) for a birthday/house warming party for Heather. The theme was a children’s party so there were sandwiches, sausage rolls, fairy cakes as well as party games – like pin the tail on the <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2528/3980750962_6b1519de9a_o.jpg">(very depressed looking) donkey</a>, and pass the parcel. Excellent idea!</p>

<p>Today we headed off on our first bike ride of the New Year, and it was hard work. The track we often cycle along was frozen so it was a bit like riding a boneshaker at times. Still, it was nice to be out in the fresh air, and it was a beautiful sunny day down here. Shame me and my bike parted company on a particularly muddy bit… Then we met up with one of our friends for Sunday lunch at <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/seafood/regency.html">The Regency Restaurant</a> before stopping to take some photos of the sky at sunset. Then finally, on to see some other friends for tea. An unexpectedly lovely weekend.</p>
