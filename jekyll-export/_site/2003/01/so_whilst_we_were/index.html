<p>So, whilst we were on our holidays another bit of the West Pier <a href="http://www.thisisbrighton.co.uk/brighton__hove/archive/2003/01/20/NEWS65ZM.html">collapsed</a>. Looks like we lost our opportunity to do a tour of it then! Bah!</p>

<p>Update: Just found <a href="http://www.realbrighton.com/story.asp?story_id=149">these photos</a>. It looks like the front (land part) of the pier has squashed even more.</p>
