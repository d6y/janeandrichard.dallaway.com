<p>The first batch of photos from Les Arcs are up now. We havenâ€™t even finished one of the films in the APS camera yet so the photos of us actually doing some snowboarding will have to wait a while, but <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/lesarcs2003/">here</a> are the scenic/general photos for now.</p>
