<p>Warning! You may find <a href="http://www.britishpathe.com/">britishpathe.com</a> addictive.</p>

<p>Just browse their archive of film from the 1896 to the 1970s by hitting the “Lucky dip” button.</p>

<p>I’ve just been looking at images of Brighton’s West Pier from 1933. The preview of the clip gives you</p>

<p>some descriptive text, but to actually view the movie you need to fill out a form and then download</p>

<p>the (Windows) media file. The very low quality preview is free (oddly they email you an invoice)</p>

<p>and has a seriously annoying “(c) BRITISH PATHE PREVIEW ONLY” banner stuck 2/3 of the way down the screen for the whole movie.</p>

<p>Still, you can splash</p>

<p>out and buy the high-quality version if you really wanted to. </p>

<p>Promisied for spring this year: 12 million still images.</p>
