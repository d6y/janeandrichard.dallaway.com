<p>Still playing with the new camera! This time with a night shot – something I’ve never been able to do before as I’ve never had a camera which you can adjust the shutter time on. So, this was taken at the camera’s maximum shutter time of 15 seconds (which I discovered is too long a bright moon!). The only adjustment I’ve made to it is to reduce the red levels a bit as there was more light pollution in the image than in reality. Tomorrow I’ll play with the other photos I took, and will probably add them to the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos">gallery</a>. If I get the feeling in my fingers back that is…</p>
