<p>After Tuesday’s <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_01_07/crw_4176_rj/">poor attempt at moon photography</a> I decided to find out a bit more about it and read an article on <a href="http://www.photo.net/nature/sunmoon">photo.net</a>, one on <a href="http://www.cliffshade.com/dpfwiw/moon.htm">dpFWIW</a> and got some advice from the <a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums">forums on dpreview</a>. So this evening, as I left the office I decided to try a few of the suggestions. I’m planning to experiment with a few other settings next time, but I’m much happier with what I got here.</p>
