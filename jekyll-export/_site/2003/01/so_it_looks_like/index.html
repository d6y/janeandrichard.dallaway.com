<p>So, it looks like the people at <a href="http://www.friendsreunited.co.uk">FriendsReunited</a> have come up with another idea. They’ve launched <a href="http://www.genesconnected.co.uk">GenesConnected</a>, a genealogical record site. So, you enter your family tree information and share it with other users. You can add your ancestors, and then search through other people’s trees to look for matches. If you find a likely looking match, you can email the contact and share your information. It has the same charging fee as FriendsReunited, so it’s a fiver per year. And from what I remember about genealogists, this won’t be a hard sell…</p>
