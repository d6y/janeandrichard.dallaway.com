<p>I had an interview on Friday, and among other bizarre questions I was asked if I planned to have children, and if so what was the timescale. Now I appreciate that I’m now 31 and that companies would have a concern about the children thing, but I’m not sure it’s an appropriate interview question.</p>

<p>Update: I’ve since discovered that it is legal to ask that as long as they ask the same questions of all other candidates. They’re not allowed to make a decision based on the answer though.</p>
