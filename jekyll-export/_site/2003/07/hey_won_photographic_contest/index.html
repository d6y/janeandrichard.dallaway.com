<p>Hey, I won a photographic contest. The <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnderExposed/">Underexposed</a> group I belong to have a monthly contest and this month’s theme was “After Dark/Sunset”. I haven’t won a photography contest since I was about 15, so I’m really pleased, especially as the other entries were all excellent too.</p>
