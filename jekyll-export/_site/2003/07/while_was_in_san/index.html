<p>While I was in San Francisco <a href="http://www.goulbourn.com/">Goul</a> took me to see <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/findingnemo/index.html">Finding Nemo</a> (watch the trailers: they can do water now). It’s a <a href="http://www.pixar.com/">Pixar</a> and Disney thing, and if you liked <a href="http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/ts/index.html">Toy Story</a>, you’ll like this too. I’m looking forward to going to see it again, but it’s not due in the UK until October.</p>
