<p>Today Jeremy and I attempted our maddest plan yet, to cycle part of the South Downs Way from Amberley to Brighton. We’re both in our notice period having been made redundant last week, so we thought it would be a good opportunity to get out there and pedal. 26 miles later and I’m absolutely exhausted although nothing aches as yet. The photo above was taken at Chanctonbury Ring (probably the highest point on our ride at around 238m).</p>
