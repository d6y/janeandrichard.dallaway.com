<p>Jeremy and I attempted to go on <a href="/2003/07/today_jeremy_and_attempted">another bike ride today</a> but it was not to be. The plan was to get the train to Southease and then cycle back to Devil’s Dyke along the South Downs Way. </p>

<p>We went to the station and bought our tickets, and then discovered that there were no trains running beyond Lewes because of emergency engineering work and so there was a bus replacement service – they didn’t tell us this when we were buying our tickets which was somewhat annoying. We consulted the map during the journey and decided on an alternative starting point for our ride, and so arrived in Lewes with a plan.</p>

<p>As we cycled up the high street my bike started to misbehave and my chain jumped off the deraileur. I fixed it, and cycled on about a further 5 metres before it came off again, this time with the deraileur being in a really odd position. It looked like there was a fracture in a piece of metal which attached it to the bike, and after only a gentle movement it snapped into two pieces. Bah! We took a quick look around Lewes for a bike shop, but drew a blank and so ended up getting on the train and returning to Brighton. 🙁</p>
