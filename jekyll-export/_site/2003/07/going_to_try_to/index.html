<p>I’m going to try to get a bunch of geek stuff out of my system in one blog…</p>

<p>I’ve thought that Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook/">ibook</a>s were more-or-less toys which could just about manage to do a bit of word processing and perhaps surfing. I’ve just finished renting one for a week, to see if I could possibly do my job with a Mac and hopefully shake off my <a href="http://www.arcterex.net/blog/archives/2003/03/28/maclust.html">maclust</a>, and my perceptions have changed. I’d now happly recommend or work with an ibook: I was able to do some software development on the machine and it was about the same as working on my Pentium III 800Mhz Linux laptop.</p>

<p>Oh, I rented from <a href="http://microrent.co.uk">Microrent</a> — if you’re looking to rent hardware, these people are great. They initially sent me a machine with the wrong version of Mac OS on it. In fact, the machine I was renting (cheapest possible) wasn’t capable of running the latest and greated OS. So they posted me out the CDs and a nice big chunk of extra memory and talked me through the upgrade. Thanks guys! </p>

<p>You may have guessed by now, but I’m hooked. I’m now the owner of a shiny new <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index17.html">powerbook</a>. I’ve <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/">switched</a>. </p>

<p>The other geek thing is that I’ve written up some notes on my trip to <a href="http://www.dallaway.com/acad/javaone2003/">JavaOne 2003, San Francisco</a>.</p>
