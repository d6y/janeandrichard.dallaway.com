<p>I applied for <a href="http://www.noagenciesplease.com/index.html?action=project&amp;id=3874">this project</a> at <a href="http://www.freelancers.net/">Freelancers.Net</a> the other day. Last night I got an email from the company asking if I could look at some emergency for them on the <a href="http://www.clix.co.uk/">Clix</a> site. I did, and sorted it for them, but whilst we were chatting the guy said that they’d had 120 responses to that advert, and that some people were offering to do the work for free just so they could put it onto their portfolio. I guess that’s why I hadn’t heard anything from them about that work. Time will tell if I get any further work from them on the strength of my emergency-helping-out ability.</p>
