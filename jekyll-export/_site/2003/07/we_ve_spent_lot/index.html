<p>We’ve spent a lot of the last couple of days catching up with <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/henstagday/img_2453_640/">Jono and Emma</a> who have been on holiday over here from Oz. It’s been great to spend some time with them, and also to catch up with the rest of the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/surprise/img_1679_640/">New Scientist crowd</a> last night.</p>
