<p><a href="http://www.petebarrwatson.com/pm/weblog.php">Pete</a> mentioned a <a href="http://www.petebarrwatson.com/pm/comments.php?id=P247_0_1_0_536">Brighton Bloggers meetup</a> a few days ago, and its starting to look like it might happen. So, Iâ€™ve offered the <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/">BrightonBloggers.com</a> space as a home for it where we hope to have details about meetups etc eventually. In the mean time there is just a list of all the Brighton Bloggers that were registered during the <a href="http://www.virtualfestival.org.uk/">Virtual Festival</a>.</p>
