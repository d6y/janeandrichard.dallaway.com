<p>I had an interview last week for which I had to do a pyschometric test. Yesterday I got to see the results of it. And they’re pretty accurate – which is scary. Apparently my descriptive words are:</p>

<p>Dependable, persistent, patient, kind, thorough, loyal, supportive, sincere, logical, systematic, steady, deliberate, communicative, friendly, persuasive, asks ‘why’, ‘who’ and ‘how’.</p>
