<p>And another M$ rant… I’m using SQL Server, and I want to (programatically) change the next identity for a new record in a table. So, I use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/tsqlref/ts_dbcc_5lv8.asp">DBCC CheckIdent</a> command. If no records have ever been inserted into the table, then I use DBCC CheckIdent (<em>[tablename]</em>, RESEED,<em>[number I want the next record to have]</em>). However, if records have been inserted then I need to use DBCC CheckIdent (<em>[tablename]</em>, RESEED, <em>[number I want the next record to have]</em> <strong>+1</strong>). What a load of pants!</p>
