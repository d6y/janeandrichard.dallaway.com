<p>Yesterday I was in London for <a href="http://www.modular2003.com">Modular 2003</a>, which I think is fair to summarize as a conference for music geeks to talk shop. The photos are from the “Analog Modular Room Installation”, but I also managed to catch some interesting talks: <a href="http://www.discover.com/mar_03/feattech.html">improvising swarms</a>, artificial music, a demo from Clavia and <a href="http://www.tecn.upf.es/~sjorda/TSI1/SI6A_archivos/v3_slide0011.htm">some whacky ideas for new instruments</a>.</p>
