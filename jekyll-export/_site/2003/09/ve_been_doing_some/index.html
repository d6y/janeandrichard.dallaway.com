<p>I’ve been doing some work with <a href="http://www.nigelgordijk.co.uk/">Nigel</a> on a site he’s designed, just doing some dhtml tinkering, and thought that before I started writing the code I’d see if I could find something that did at least some of what we wanted. Thanks to <a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex5/linkinfo.htm">Dynamic Drive</a> I’ve only had to make the content specific, everything else worked like a dream – across IE 6, Mozilla 1.4 and Safari 1. A <a href="http://dynamicdrive.com/">pretty useful site</a>, and some pretty useful code too.</p>
