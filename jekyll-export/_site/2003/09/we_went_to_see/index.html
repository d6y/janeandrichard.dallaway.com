<p>We went to see <a href="http://www.whaleriderthemovie.com/">Whale Rider</a> this afternoon at the <a href="http://www.dukeofyorkscinema.com/">Duke of Yorks</a>. A beautiful, moving film, and served to the accompaniment of free <a href="http://www.benandjerrys.com/">Ben and Jerrys</a> ice cream. What could be better. Big thanks to the Vic, Kaye, Jeremy and Rachel for recommending it to us.</p>
