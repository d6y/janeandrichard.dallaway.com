<p>This evening was my first visit of the year to the <a href="www.bhcc-online.co.uk">Brighton and Hove Camera Club</a>. Our speaker this evening was <a href="http://www.ashford-quest-photo-soc.co.uk/john-devenport.htm">John Devenport</a> showing prints on the theme of “Monochrome Images”. Some of them were very impressive, although I must be honest and say that he showed far too many photos for my taste – by the end of the evening I was suffering with a numb bum – one of the perils of sitting on the cheap seats at the back of the room. Despite that a very inspiring presentation, and it has made me want to go and get the camera out and start taking some more photos.</p>
