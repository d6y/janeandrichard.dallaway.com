<p>Iâ€™ve recently done a bit of work with <a href="http://www.nigelgordijk.com/">Nigel</a> on the <a href="http://www.delphicconsulting.com/">Delphic Consulting</a> website. He did all the pretty bits, I made some dhtml stuff work. We got a write up on <a href="http://www.wiredsussex.com/News/0309/commonsensedelphic.html">Wired Sussex</a> today ðŸ™‚</p>
