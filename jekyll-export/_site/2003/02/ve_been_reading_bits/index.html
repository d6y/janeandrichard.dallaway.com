<p>I’ve been reading bits of the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> (<a href="http://www.jonoabroad.com/">Jono</a>‘s fault), and it made for interesting reading: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/england/2755301.stm">Eriksson upbeat despite loss</a> (BBC) vs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/13/1044927744243.html">Savour the perfect 10</a> (SMH). More interesting, though, is the SMH’s take on the UK press (<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/13/1044927744538.html">‘Load of roo-bish’ causes a stink on Fleet Street</a>) and the BBC’s take on the Australian press (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/england/2756777.stm">Pom-bashing gathers pace</a>).</p>

<p>It’s quite odd getting different perspectives from “local” sources. I might add the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/">San Francisco Chronicle</a> to my reading too.</p>
