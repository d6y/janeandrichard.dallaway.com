<p>The web logs for this site tell us that people have been asking search engines questions like “when is pancake day” or “pancake day 2003 UK” and ending up <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/pancakes2002/">on a page of pancake pictures from last year</a>. Not very helpful. So, for those of your searching for this information….This year, pancake day is Tuesday 4th March (2003).</p>

<p>Pancake day is always the day before Ash Wednesday. Ash Wednesday is 40 days before Easter. And you can work out the date for Easter with <a href="http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/etc/ktf/app/easter.html">some maths</a> (including C source code. Woohoo).</p>
