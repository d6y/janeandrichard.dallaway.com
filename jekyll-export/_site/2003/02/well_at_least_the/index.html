<p>Well, at least the councillers have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2801859.stm">approved the West Pier restoration plans</a>. The campaigners against the plans have vowed to fight on to <a href="http://www.saveourseafront.org.uk/">save their seafront views</a>. Personally, I believe if they protest too much the pier will beyond repair and will have to go – and that’s something I’d hate to see.</p>
