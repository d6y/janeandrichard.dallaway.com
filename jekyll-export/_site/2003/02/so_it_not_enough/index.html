<p>So, it’s not enough that the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2677437.stm">West Pier is slowly collapsing into the sea</a>, but the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2726951.stm">Palace Pier had to get in on the act too</a>. Last night, one of the fair rides caught on fire, and blazed into the night sky (apparently – I didn’t hear anything about it until 10pm or so by which time it was all out). I cycled off this morning to take a look and the pier generally still looks intact. The Police said that they thought that only the Ghost Train and the Helter Skelter had been damaged, and that all the structures still seemed to be ok, although they needed the engineers to come and check it out.</p>
