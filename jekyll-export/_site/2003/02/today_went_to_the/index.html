<p>Today I went to the <a href="http://www.t-f-m.co.uk/">Technology for Marketing show</a> at Kensington Olympia with Jeremy. All the previous exhibitions I’ve been to have all been purely technology based (well, except for the <a href="http://www.idealhomeshow.co.uk/">Ideal Home Show</a> which doesn’t really count!) and so it made a change to see a show which targets a specific sector. The exhibition seemed to be mainly full of businesses offering direct marketing services, CRM services or search engine placements. We found one company who were doing something similar to <a href="http://www.fluidnetwork.com">Fluid Network</a> and so we had a long chat with them.</p>

<p>And just for the record, the best conference freebies were a <a href="http://www.experiancontactmail.com/">red stress frog</a>, and a <a href="http://www.commencecountdown.com">light-up pen</a>.</p>
