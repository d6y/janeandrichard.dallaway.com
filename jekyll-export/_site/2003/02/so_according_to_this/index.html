<p>So, according to <a href="http://www.brandchannel.com/start1.asp?id=143">this article</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> was the number one global brand for 2002. Okay, admittedly, it was an on-line poll :-)! However, in <a href="http://www.brandchannel.com/2002_BOTY/europe_2002.html">Europe and Africa</a>, <a href="http://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a> was top, with Google not even making the top 10.</p>
