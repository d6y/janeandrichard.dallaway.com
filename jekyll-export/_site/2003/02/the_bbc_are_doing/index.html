<p>The BBC are doing a special holiday programme on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/50/">50 things to do before you die</a>. Currently theyâ€™re accepting submissions from people suggesting ideas of what theyâ€™ve done or what theyâ€™d like to do â€“ Iâ€™ve submitted two, one Iâ€™ve done and one Iâ€™d love to do.</p>

<p>So, the one Iâ€™ve done is see an eclipse [<a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/1999/08/hungary/">Hungary 1999</a>] and the one Iâ€™d love to do is see the northern lights. Iâ€™m sure I can think of many more, but I thought two was a good start ðŸ™‚</p>
