<p>I’ve been a fan of Terry Gilliam <a href="http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/">films</a></p>

<p>for a while,</p>

<p>although he’s perhaps more famous for the not</p>

<p>making films, or almost making films, or maybe for film</p>

<p>studious worrying about the films he makes with huge</p>

<p>piles of their money. While trying</p>

<p>to track down the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/dvd/0783225903/contents/ref=pm_dp_ln_d_6/103-3177357-3099000">DVD version of Brazil</a>, I spotted</p>

<p>the following on the <a href="http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/">Terry Gilliam Fanzine</a>:</p>

<p>“Lost in La Mancha gains BAFTA nomination”. Turns out</p>

<p>that <a href="http://www.smart.co.uk/lostinlamancha/">Lost in La Mancha</a></p>

<p>is the documentary of the making of his film, <a href="http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/donqfact.htm">The Man Who Killed Don Quixote</a> that failed to be</p>

<p>made (did that make any sense?). Lost in La Mancha was apparently released</p>

<p>in August 2002, and should be on DVD by the end of the month (<a href="http://www.ifctv.com/ifc/films/1,6387,CAT0-43-CAT1-2987-SHID-18344-VID-2625-CLR-red-BCLR-CC0000-,00.html">view the trailer</a>).</p>
