<p>Grrrr…. I’ve been using the search facility on my (newly xp’d) pc a lot this morning, desperately trying to find a function in one of my source files. I knew it was there, as the code works, but I couldn’t find it. I was using the “A word of phrase in the file” search and it was bringing back no results. So, I <a href="http://www.google.com">google</a>d it and found <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q309173">this</a>. Apparently source code files aren’t very “relevant” and so those helpful people at M$ have removed them from the search so as not to “pollute” the results. Thanks for that then!</p>
