<p>More positive consumer news… a while ago we switched from our <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=audi%20a3">Audi A3</a> petrol automatic to a manual <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=honda+civic">Honda Civic</a> diesel. (Why? 33mpg to 55mpg, amongst other reason). The <a href="http://www.yeomanshonda.co.uk">Yeomans Honda in Bognor Regis</a> were great, did us a fine deal. Recommended. </p>

<p>At the time we were told the servicing was every 12,000 miles. Turns out from the log book, it’s every 9,000 miles. Ouch. Called Yeomans, even though it was a word of mouth difference, the sales guy, Drew, said yes he remembers saying that, and appologized: it’s 12,000 on petrol, which is where the confusion came it. We figure over the life time of the car we’d end up doing one extra service, so Yeomans put everything right by giving us a free service to make up the difference. So… Yeomans are recommended further for fixing the problem, and they’re top of our list next time we go looking to change vehicle.</p>
