<p>Just been out to do a bit more Christmas shopping and stumbled into <a href="http://www.sheactive.co.uk/">SheActive</a>, a women only sports shop that recently opened in <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=530996&amp;y=104259&amp;z=1&amp;sv=530996,104259&amp;st=4&amp;mapp=newmap.srf&amp;searchp=newsearch.srf&amp;dn=516">Brighton</a>. This strikes me as a great idea as normally when looking for <a href="http://www.sheactive.co.uk/sport.html?cart=110217369271873234&amp;group=2&amp;type=sport">cycling gear</a> I struggle to find many women’s options in local stores, and end up ordering from <a href="http://www.groundeffect.co.nz/">Ground Effect</a> in New Zealand (great kit, just a long way away). I managed to come away only having bought a <a href="http://www.sheactive.co.uk/item_detail.html?itemno=586&amp;group=9&amp;type=sport&amp;cart=110217387171882115">bag</a> this time, but I’ll be back next time I need some new kit.</p>
