<p>I had my first experience of opera on Sunday evening. Richard took me to see <a href="http://www.metopera.org/synopses/aida.html">Aida</a> at the <a href="http://www.brightoncentre.co.uk/">Brighton Centre</a> performed by the <a href="http://www.mvdaily.com/articles/2002/10/muntean1.htm">Chisinau National Opera</a>. I enjoyed <a href="http://www.theatre-wales.co.uk/reviews/reviews_details.asp?reviewID=889">it</a>, although I hadn’t prepared myself for it being quite so long… I’m not sure if opera is really my thing, but the sound of an orchestra takes some beating and so I suspect we’ll head off to a classical concert at some point.</p>
