<p>So, itâ€™s Christmas Eve and all is well. All our food has arrived from the various internet-order places (organic vegetables from <a href="http://www.riverford.co.uk/en/">Riverford</a>, meats from <a href="http://www.welshfarmorganics.co.uk/">Welsh Farm Organics</a> and a turkey breast joint from <a href="http://www.kelly-turkeys.com/">Kelly Turkeys</a>). All that remains is for me to get cooking.</p>
