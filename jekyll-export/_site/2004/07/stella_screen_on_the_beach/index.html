<p>Last Saturday evening we managed to catch an hour or so of the <a href="http://www.stellascreen.co.uk/ok.html">Stella Screen</a> on the beach showing of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079766/">Quadrophenia</a>. Probably not the best way to really see a film, but a lovely way to spend part of an evening.</p>
