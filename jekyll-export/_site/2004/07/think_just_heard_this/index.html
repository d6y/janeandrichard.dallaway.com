<p>I think I just heard this phrase on the radio:</p>

<p>“…meanwhile, over on Radio 4 long wave, lawn mower racing…” </p>

<p>A bit of digging reveals <a href="http://www.racemower.co.uk/">racemower.co.uk</a>, and the fact that today is the British Lawn Mower Racing Association’s annual 12 hour race. </p>

<p>“As the grasshead racers gun their Atcos and Qualcasts round a field in Dorset at a dizzying 35mph, Murray [Walker] is moved to pick up his commentator’s microphone once more to describe this most spectacular, and democratic, of motor sports. ” </p>

<p>I’d better go tune in…</p>
