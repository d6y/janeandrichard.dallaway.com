<p>For anyone who missed the <a href="http://www.notcon04.com">NotCon’04</a> (like me), there’s now <a href="http://www.ejhp.net/notcon/">audio and video</a> to watch. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ntk.net">NTK</a> described NotCon as: “is an informal, low-cost, one-day conference on things that technologies were perhaps not intended to do”. I can recommend “Telling the time (not very accurately) using a Marks &amp; Spencer prawn sandwich and a BBC micro”.</p>
