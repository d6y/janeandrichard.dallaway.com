<p>We went to see <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/shared/fds/hi/statistics/cricket/scorecards/2004/7/6852/html/scorecard.stm">Sussex v Hampshire</a> at Twenty20 cricket on Friday evening. I’d expected a far higher scoring game, and at 6 for 3 I was wondering whether I should change allegiance to become a Hampshire Hawks supporter. It was my first cricket match, and it was quite enjoyable (although I didn’t get the hang of all the <a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/cricket/story/0,10069,976281,00.html">Twenty20 rules</a>). I was very impressed with how family oriented the whole occasion was, with children playing ball games before the match and a good, friendly atmosphere with home and away supporters mixed together.</p>

<p>The beer was good, but the sausage and chips was a total rip off.</p>
