<p>I had a lovely surpise arrive in the post this morning. My copy of Muriel Spark’s <em>All the Poems</em> arrived. It’s the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/185754773X/richarddallaway">hardback</a> version, published by <a href="http://www.carcanet.co.uk/">Carcanet Press</a> and it has <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/summerfireworks/img_0449_640/">one of my pictures</a> on the front of it, and a credit on the back. There is also a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811215768/richarddallaway">softback</a> version published by <a href="http://www.wwnorton.com/">W W Norton</a> in the US.</p>
