<p>I’ve learnt some technical stuff today which makes the installation of our product a lot easier:</p>

<ol>
  <li>you can tell <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/msde/default.asp">MSDE</a> to use mixed authentication mode by adding SECURITYMODE=SQL into the setup.ini file or as a parameter</li>
  <li>you can start the SQL Server and SQL Agent services using “net start MSSqlServer” and “net start SqlServerAgent” </li>
  <li>you can make a batch file call an external program and wait until its finished before doing the next thing by using “Start /w appname” (/w means wait)</li>
</ol>
