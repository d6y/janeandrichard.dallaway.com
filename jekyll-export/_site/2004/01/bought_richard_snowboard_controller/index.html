<p>I bought Richard a <a href="http://www.gameseek.co.uk/productdetail/PS2qtrmqt1rg077keax/">snowboard controller</a> for the PS2 for Christmas. Last night I used it to play <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009LW7Q/richarddallaway">SSX3</a> (rather than just use <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068CHU/richarddallaway">SSX</a> in training mode and try and achieve a straight line which had been all I managed to date). I’m not sure how much, if any, it’ll help me when we go snowboarding later in the season, but my calf muscles ache so I guess it’ll strengthen them if nothing else.</p>
