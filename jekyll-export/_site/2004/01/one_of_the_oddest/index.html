<p>One of the oddest evenings we spent in Calcutta was our last night. All the friends of the wedding party went out to a bar (Someplace Else) and club (Tantra) for a session (both part of the <a href="http://www.theparkhotels.com/magazine2.htm">Park Hotel</a>). In the bar we watched the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3363041.stm">Arsenal v Middlesborough</a> premiership game, listened to lots of soft rock (Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams and the like) before <a href="http://www.qedmusic.com/">Q.E.D.</a>, a canadian rock band, performed. We really could have been anywhere, except that the clientelle were a little different to UK bars/clubs.</p>
