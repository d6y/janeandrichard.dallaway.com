<p>This morning has been a photo editing marathon. I’ve worked through the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/india2004/index.html">photos of Calcutta</a> and have started the sorting of the photos of Neela and Ste’s wedding.</p>

<p>I had 307 wedding photos (excluding video) and have reduced this to 79 so far – so still some more culling to go before I have them finished.</p>
