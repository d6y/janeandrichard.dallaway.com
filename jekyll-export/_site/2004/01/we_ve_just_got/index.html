<p>We’ve just got back to Brighton after our hectic Christmas/New Year/Early January. Christmas was spent in Brighton, New Year in Margate (unexpectedly), and Early January was spent in Kolkata, India where we attended a friend’s wedding (which was a fantastic experience). So now we have to sort ourselves out and find homes for all those lovely Christmas presents!</p>
