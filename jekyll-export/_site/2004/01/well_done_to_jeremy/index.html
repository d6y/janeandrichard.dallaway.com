<p>Well done to Jeremy and Andy for braving the</p>

<p>Brighton sea on Christmas morning.</p>

<p>We watched the crazy folk going in</p>

<p><a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/christmasday2002/">last year</a>, on what was an unusually</p>

<p>warm day, and Jeremy said he thought he’d give it a go in 2003. </p>

<p>I think Andy was talked or bullied into it</p>

<p>the night before, but I may be wrong.</p>

<p>I assumed he was joking about going in wearing the Santa costume. </p>

<p>Once fortified with mulled wine, they dived in and</p>

<p>did the required full submersion and at least five strokes — this</p>

<p>being Kirsty’s definition of the minimum needed</p>

<p>to qualify as “going for a swim on Christmas morning”. This all</p>

<p>happened to be before the official Christmas day swimmers</p>

<p>got going, thereby inadvertently grabbing the attention</p>

<p>of the crowd on the beach, including the press. </p>
