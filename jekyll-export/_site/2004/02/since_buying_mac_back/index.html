<p>Since <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/stories/markfrauenfelder.html">buying a Mac</a></p>

<p>back in <a href="/2003/07/going_to_try_to">July</a> I’ve become</p>

<p>everything I swore I’d never become: <a href="http://www.applelinks.com/articles/2003/01/20030124155752.shtml">a Mac bore</a>,</p>

<p>banging on about Mac this and Mac that, and how all Windows</p>

<p>users are wasting their lives. I don’t know how</p>

<p>this happened. I suppose I’m just more</p>

<p>optimistic when I use a Mac. Or maybe I’m a sucker for the marketing.</p>

<p>Either way, things seem better. Anyway…a</p>

<p>couple of days ago my Mac died on me: hardware</p>

<p>problems, and it’s heading back to the mother ship to get</p>

<p>some of that [crashed saucer</p>

<p>technology](http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02000-04-21&amp;l=169#l)</p>

<p>refitted. So “up to seven working days” of life back</p>

<p>in the Windows world for me. It’s not a shock, it’s just… harder.</p>

<p>Windows does pretty much all the same things, but in a more complicated, gets-in-the-way, kind</p>

<p>of style. There are a zillion dull tiny details, but they add</p>

<p>up to quite a different experience.</p>

<p>Ok, there I go again. So, time for a late new year’s resolution: don’t mention</p>

<p>how great Apple machines are ever again. Let’s see how long that lasts…</p>
