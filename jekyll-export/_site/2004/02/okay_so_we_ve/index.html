<p>Okay, so we’ve all seen the geek joke about <a href="http://www.drunkcow.com/content/420.html">upgrading girlfriend version 1.0 to wife version 1.0</a> etc, well an american has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3451207.stm">taken it one step further</a>. His poor son appears to have been named Jon Blake Cusack 2.0. I’m kind of surprised that I can’t find a website announcing the upgrade although I’m sure it’s only time.</p>
