<p>Over Christmas we recorded <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280778/">Iris</a> when it was on the tv. Last night we got around to watching it. It’s a very, very good film, although it is pretty upsetting watching such a sharp mind deteriorate due to Alzheimers disease. The acting was very good, and Jim Broadbent totally deserved <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2002/oscars_2002/1887921.stm">his oscar</a> for it as his sense of frustration felt so real. One thing they didn’t do was give any indication of the timeline of her deterioration, but on <a href="http://www.aesthetics-online.org/memorials/bonzon.html">further investigation</a> it appears to have been 4 or 5 years. <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/">Dementia</a> is such an awful disease, stripping away facets of personality leaving a barely recognisable shell, and as yet their is no cure – just treatments that delay the inevitable.</p>
