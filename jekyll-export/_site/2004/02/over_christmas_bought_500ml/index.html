<p>Over Christmas I bought a 500ml bottle of <a href="http://www.moltonbrown.co.uk/shop/moreinfo.cfm?itemid=46&amp;price=&#xA3;11.00">Molton Brown Shower gel</a>. Last week I started using it and dropped it, smashing the pump dispenser lid. Over the weekend I went into the <a href="http://www.moltonbrown.co.uk/index.cfm?currency=GBP">Molton Brown</a> shop and asked if I could buy a <a href="http://www.moltonbrown.co.uk/shop/moreinfo.cfm?itemid=221&amp;price=&#xA3;1.50">replacement dispenser</a>. Unfortunately they donâ€™t stock them for the big bottles, but the lady found a 500ml bottle from their stock room, took out the dispenser, washed it and gave it to me, all for no cost. Good customer service still lives.</p>
