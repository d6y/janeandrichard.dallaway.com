<p>I’ve been meaning to set up a stocks and shares ISA for 2003/4 since about, er, last April but last week I finally got around to it. I had a conversation with a “finance aware” friend of mine who recommended I take a look at <a href="http://www.elsonassociates.com/">Elson Associates</a>. I did, and I was quite impressed by the amount of discount they offer off initial charges – it makes quite a difference and I’ll probably take a look at the 2004/5 offers after April.</p>
