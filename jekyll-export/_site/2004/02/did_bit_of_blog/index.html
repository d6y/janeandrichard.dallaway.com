<p>I did a bit of blog hopping this morning, starting from <a href="http://www.nyclondon.com/blog/">nyclondon</a> and then heading to <a href="http://www.londonphotos.org/">LondonPhotos</a> before spotting their section on <a href="http://www.londonphotos.org/archives/cat_polaroid_manipulation.html">Polaroid Manipulation</a>. It was interesting to read some of the <a href="http://www.londonphotos.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=23">comments</a> especially the one from “o+” about how it was considered trite when he was at school. Strange how something that was once trite has become interesting because it’s now unusual.</p>
