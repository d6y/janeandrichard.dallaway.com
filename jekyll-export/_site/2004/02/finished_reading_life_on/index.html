<p>I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0563487801/richarddallaway">Life on Air</a> by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/who/david_attenborough.shtml">David Attenborough</a> over the weekend. I don’t read many autobiographies but I really enjoyed this one – it’s really well written, and full of facts about the places, animals and people he’s spent time with. Thanks to <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/neelastewedding/190_9042_r1/">Ash and Mitűl</a> for recommending and then buying it for us.</p>
