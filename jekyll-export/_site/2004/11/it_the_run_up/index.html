<p>It’s the run up to Christmas, and so on Saturday we headed off to the <a href="http://www.cite-europe.com/prod/index.jsp?pays=2">Cite Europe</a> shopping centre in Calais to stock up on cheaper booze (with hundreds of other brits judging by how busy the place was).</p>

<p>We used the <a href="http://www.eurotunnel.co.uk/ukcmain">Eurotunnel again</a>, and again were impressed with it. The fact that it is less than 5 minutes from the terminal to Cite Europe is pretty handy too and even the return trip only took us about 20 minutes (although you do wonder where they’re taking you as you can see the terminal from the East Car Park).</p>

<p>We bought most of our alcohol from <a href="http://www.tesco-france.com/frame.asp?rub=&amp;main=home&amp;left=left">Tesco</a> – using the <a href="http://www.superplonk.com/">Superplonk</a> data to work out what the best deals were. We managed to track down enough to keep us going for a while anyways. One thing we noticed was that Tesco’s do an <a href="http://www.tesco.com/vinplus/ListePrix.pdf">ordering service</a> – we might give that a try next time.</p>

<p>We stopped for lunch in <a href="http://www.lemoulinabiere.com/">Le Moulin a Biere</a> (getting 10% off because we’d been to Tescos) and then had a good wander around the rest of the shops, and finished off in <a href="http://www.carrefour.com/english/homepage/index.jsp">Carrefour</a> buying some cheese, and a few more bottles of wine.</p>
