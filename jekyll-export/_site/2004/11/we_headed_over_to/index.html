<p>We headed over to <a href="http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/">Lewes</a> for the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3988037.stm">Bonfire celebrations</a> on Friday – it was a pretty chilly night but we stuck around long enough to watch the processions before heading home to warm up with a lovely pecan pie treat. I took some photos, but at the moment they’re still in a processing queue – so, if you want to see what its all about there are photos for <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_11_05/">2003</a>, <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/bonfire_2002/">2002</a> and <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/bonfire_2001/">2001</a>.</p>
