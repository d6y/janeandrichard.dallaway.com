<p><a href="">Wired News</a> are carrying a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64419,00.html/wn_ascii">story</a> about <a href="http://a.parsons.edu/~jk/spectropolis/josh.html">Joshua Kinberg</a>, a guy who is leaving <a href="http://www.bikesagainstbush.com/">Anti Bush messages around New York using his pushbike, a dot matrix printer and a powerbook</a>. His previous project was <a href="http://www.magicbike.net/">magicbike</a>, a mobile WiFi hotspot. Sounds like a smart guy with some interesting technology projects on the go.</p>
