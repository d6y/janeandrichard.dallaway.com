<p>We saw <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/hamhouse/">Marisa and Erena</a> the other week for a trip to Ham House, and while we were there Marisa handed me a copy of her latest book. You’ve <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4876150907">got a copy</a>, right? Well, flip to page 247 and there I am making guest appearance in unit 10: “Making an appointment with a GP”. Fame at last! Thank you Marisa. I going to try very hard to follow the script word-for-word the next time I need to phone my GP :-)”</p>
