<p>I’ve really enjoyed the <a href="http://www.athens2004.com/">Olympics</a> (so far) and today decided to go and take a look at the <a href="http://www.london2012.org/en">London 2012</a> proposition. Whilst I was there I discovered the <a href="http://www.london2012.org/en/support/">Support Us</a> section, and so have added my name to their <a href="http://www.london2012.org/en/support/register/Register.htm">collection of interested parties</a>.</p>
