<p>I’ve been following the <a href="http://www.athens2004.com/">Olympics</a> when I’ve had a few spare moments at home, but had been failing to find any online coverage to listen to at work. Fortunately, today, <a href="http://www.eurosport.com/home/pages/V4/L0/S82/playermultimedia_Lng0_Rub9_Spo82_Ven17498.shtml">Eurosport</a> came to my rescue and so I’m now able to listen to <a href="http://www.olympics.org.uk/teamgb/teamgb.asp">Team GB</a>‘s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/medals_table/3536512.stm">progress</a>.</p>
