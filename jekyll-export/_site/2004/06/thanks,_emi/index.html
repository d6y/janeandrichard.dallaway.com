<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00014TJUC/richarddallaway">Absent Friends</a> is a great album. As a CD, it’s terrible. Let me explain…</p>

<p>Someone, somewhere, in their wisdom has decided that this CD would be “copy controlled”. That <a href="http://www.members.shaw.ca/cafdir/fakecds.htm">means</a> “on some equipment, for example car CD players, playback problems may be encountered”. I guess our experience of “it not working at all” counts as a “playback problem”. </p>

<p>So: I put the CD in my laptop, ripped the CD, and then wrote a new audio CD, and it works properly in the car. Should I bill EMI for my time and materials? </p>

<p>This isn’t particularly new, but it’s so annoying: I’ve paid money for the music, why can’t I be allowed to play it where I want? Anyway… dumb is the only word I can think of for <a href="http://www.newolde.com/copy_controlled_cd.htm">this situation</a>.</p>
