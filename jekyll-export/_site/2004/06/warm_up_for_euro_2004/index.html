<p>BBC News have a helpful article on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3786393.stm">how to avoid getting an injury when watching football on the tv</a> based on a <a href="http://admin.csp.org.uk/admin2/uploads/2200d5-f7cdd2303d--7018/CSPFootballleafA5Inter.pdf">factsheet</a> provided by <a href="http://www.csp.org.uk/">The Chartered Society of Physiotherapists</a> [warning: very slow website]. It recommends <em>“In a situation when you can reasonably anticipate a goal, prepare your body by getting up off the sofa carefully so that you are already standing and then you can jump up and down, instead of springing off the sofa”</em>, as well as making sure food and drink are nearby to avoid incidents through “lunging”. It must be a slow news day!</p>
