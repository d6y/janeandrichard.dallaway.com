<p>Some friends have just had a baby boy, to go with their already lovely daughter. A couple of years ago we sent a <a href="http://www.hugsandcuddles.co.uk/products/Moonbeam_14_inch.html">lovely bear</a> to some other friends through <a href="http://www.hugsandcuddles.co.uk/">Hugs and Cuddles</a>. Unfortunately, the bear is out of stock at the moment, and so I started looking around for other cuddly toy sites – and <a href="http://www.interfauna.co.uk/">interfauna</a> is the winner. Not only has it a fantastic name, but it also has a massive range of animals – even a <a href="http://www.interfauna.co.uk/mall/Interfauna/products/product-1063837.stm">jellyfish</a>, . This time, however, the <a href="http://www.interfauna.co.uk/mall/Interfauna/products/product-800974.stm">red panda</a> wins.</p>
