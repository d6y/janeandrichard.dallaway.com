<p>I’ve been looking after the <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/">Brighton Bloggers</a> site, and consequently this morning got an email from someone wanting a blog added to the list of <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blogs/">Brighton Blogs</a>. The email said “<a href="http://www.plot9.com/beached/today.htm">BEACHED</a> is a photographic Blog chronicling life on</p>

<p>Brighton Beach, England during British Summertime 2004.” Great concept, and so far it’s quite lovely.</p>
