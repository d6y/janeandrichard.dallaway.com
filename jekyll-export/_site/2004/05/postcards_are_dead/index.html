<p>I was amazed that I could get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:gprs">GPRS service</a> on my phone while in <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/Canada2004/bigwhite/">Canada</a>. GPRS meant I could send and receive email. Ok, it wasn’t terrible fast 5,760ft up in <a href="http://www.bigwhite.com/submenus/BigWhiteMaps/mapdisplay.php?map_id=driving">the middle of nowhere</a>, but it worked, so naturally I <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Abcc">bcc:ed</a> a few people photos I’d taken with the phone. So much more personal than a default postcard, <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/I/IMHO.html">IMHO</a>. And faster. Probably not cheaper. </p>

<p>Today I received the same back from a friend on holiday in Greece, so I can confirm that, on the receiving side, I prefer this to postcards.</p>
