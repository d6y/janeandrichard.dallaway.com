<p>I’ve just seen an article on <a href="http://www.theboarder.co.uk/">TheBoarder</a> about a <a href="http://www.dianfossey.org/events/sking_information.html">charity</a> event happening at <a href="http://www.xscape.co.uk/castleford/Default.asp?f=1">Castleford Xscape</a> snow dome in June. It involves dressing up in a gorilla costume and snowboarding/skiing with the intention of completing 100 miles in an hour between all the participants. The snowboarding bit doesn’t seem so bad, but managing to get on the poma lift dressed as a gorilla sounds hard. Good luck to all those who take part.</p>
