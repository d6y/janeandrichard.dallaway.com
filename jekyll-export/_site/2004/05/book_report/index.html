<p>I’ve just finished reading <a href="/2004/02/finished_reading_life_on">another</a> couple of autobiographies. The first was <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060532203/richarddallaway">“Pretty good for a girl” by Tina Basich</a> and the second was <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0224060872/richarddallaway">“It’s not about the bike : My journey back to life” by Lance Armstrong</a>.</p>

<p>Both are about sporting personalities, <a href="http://expn.go.com/athletes/bios/n/BASICH_TINA.html">Tina Basich</a> is a snowboarder who was one of the pioneers of female snowboarding and successful too having won many events including the Big Air competition at the 1998 Winter X Games, <a href="http://www.lancearmstrong.com/">Lance Armstrong</a> is a very successful cyclist having won the Tour de France 5 times despite (or maybe because of) fighting through a major illness.</p>

<p>Both were well written, both had poignant moments, both of them are inspiring. I might add <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0224064738/richarddallaway">“Every Second Counts” by Lance Armstrong</a> to my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/wishlist/EQ852DWZQO11/ref=wl_em_to">wish list</a>.</p>
