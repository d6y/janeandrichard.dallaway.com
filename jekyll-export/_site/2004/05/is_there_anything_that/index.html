<p>Is there anything that can’t be Abba-ified? I suspect not after noticing that June 10th is <a href="http://www.brighton-racecourse.co.uk/">Brighton Racecource</a>‘s “Thank you for the races” Abba night. </p>

<p>I quote: “This Super Trouper Evening will include a Live Tribute Band, competitions for the best dressed Abba character and drinks promotions all night – Mamma Mia this is a night not to be missed!”</p>
