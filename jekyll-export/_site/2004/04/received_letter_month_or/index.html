<p>I received a letter a month or so ago from a distant cousin who was interested in sharing some of her <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/tree/index.html">family tree</a> research. This made me realise how long it has been since I did any work on the tree whatsoever. So this evening I decided to try out the <a href="http://www.census.pro.gov.uk/">1901 census online</a>. £5 later I’ve found out addresses for where 2 of my Grandparents were, along with more general information about the <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/tree/Garnett/index.html">third’s parents</a>. The <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/tree/Duffield/index.html">fourth’s family</a>, however, remains elusive. It’s a pretty good service, and seems to be pretty responsive when you consider the amount of people who are in the list.</p>

<p>If anyone happens to be looking for a George S Duffield (aged 6 months) or a John E Duffield (aged 26 years, lodging with the Catley family) in Hull in around 1901 then drop me a line as I have information on these people.</p>

<p>And if anyone happens to know anything about my <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/tree/Duffield/index.html">Duffield</a>s then please get in touch.</p>
