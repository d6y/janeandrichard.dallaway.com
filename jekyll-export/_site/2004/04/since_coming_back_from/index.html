<p>Since coming back from <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/Canada2004">Canada</a> we’ve bought a few </p>

<p>snowboarding magazines and books to tide us over and help us find a great resort for next </p>

<p>year. We bought the World Snowboard &lt;/p&gt; </p>

<p>guide 2004&lt;/a&gt; which has a useful looking <a href="http://www.worldsnowboardguide.com/">accompanying site</a> and seems pretty detailed </p>

<p>but the spelling mistakes let it down somewhat, also a copy of <a href="http://www.sukmag.com/">Snowboard UK</a> and a copy of <a href="http://www.onboardmag.com/">Onboard</a>. We’ve also ordered a year’s subscription to </p>

<p>the <a href="http://www.thesnowboardjournal.com/">Snowboard Journal</a> on Luke’s &lt;/p&gt; </p>

<p>recommendation&lt;/a&gt; but the shipping to the UK is sloooow (6 – 8 weeks) and so we haven’t </p>

<p>received our first issue yet.</p>
