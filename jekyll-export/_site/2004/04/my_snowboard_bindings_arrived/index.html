<p>My snowboard bindings arrived yesterday, and very pleased I am too. I originally ordered some special “lady” <a href="http://www.flow.com/">flow</a> bindings, but despite <a href="http://www.roho.co.uk/snowboard/index.html">Robin Hood Watersports</a> saying they had them to sell, they later emailed me to say they didn’t. 🙁 So, I opted for some Pro 11 flow’s from <a href="http://www.edge2edge.co.uk/acatalog/Edge_2_Edge_Online-NEW_SNOWBOARDS-SNOWBOARD_BINDING.html">edge2edge</a>. I bought them when they were still at full price, but they sold them at their sale price – so I got £35 off them. Thank you <a href="http://www.edge2edge.co.uk/">edge2edge</a> 😀</p>

<p>This evening we attached our bindings to our boards (with not too much difficulty)- we just need to find some snow now…</p>
