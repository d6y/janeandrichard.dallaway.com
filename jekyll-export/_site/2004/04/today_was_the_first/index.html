<p>Today was the first day on my c# course with <a href="http://www.xpertise.co.uk/">Xpertise</a>. I haven’t had an opportunity to work with .Net before so this is a great opportunity. So tonight I’ve installed the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=9B3A2CA6-3647-4070-9F41-A333C6B9181D&amp;displaylang=en">SDK</a>. I don’t have a Visual Studio .Net license, so instead I downloaded <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx">#develop</a>, a free development environment which so far appears to work okay. It comes with <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/wiki">ndoc</a> for documentation and #unit for unit testing, althought I’m probably going to use <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">nunit</a> instead.</p>
