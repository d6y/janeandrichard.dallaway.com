<p>The National Audit Office has reported <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/pn/03-04/0304359.htm">on UK Space activities</a>. The glossy executive summary talks of the need for a “more consistent approach to the analysis of the risks”. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the story that <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4479868/">B2 may have been spotted on Mars</a> is dismissed by CP as noise in the image. The current theory is that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3543295.stm">B2 was going too fast</a> when it hit the thinner than expected Martian atmosphere. Another avenue of investigation is an <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/09/1078594370654.html">anomaly in an image of B2 as it separated</a> from Mars Express. “The bright object and the glint on the side of Beagle 2 may be nothing, they may be everything”.</p>

<p>And the hunt for Beagle 1 has focused on <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2004/03/10/ecfbeag10.xml&amp;sSheet=/connected/2004/03/10/ixconn.html">8ft of mud in the Essex marshes</a>. “For the latter part of its life, the Beagle lived modestly as a coastguard watch vessel in Essex to combat gangs of smugglers in the Southend Coastguard District”.</p>

<p>Great news: There are plans to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3519626.stm">relaunch B2</a> in 2007. Bad news for the guy who registered beagle3.com on Christmas day: the project will keep the B2 name.</p>
