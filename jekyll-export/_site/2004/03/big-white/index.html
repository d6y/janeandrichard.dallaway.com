<p><strong>March 2004</strong></p>

<p>We headed off for a weeks snowboarding to <a href="http://www.bigwhite.com/">Big White</a> in Canada, and tagged a day in Vancouver on the front to take advantage of a good exchange rate to buy some <a href="http://www.sportmart.ca/store/2index.asp?countryID=0">cheaper snowboarding gear</a>. Managed to eat in a great restaurant, before heading off to Big White. We’d hired a Dodge Dorango so fitting 5 of us plus gear in wasn’t a problem – although picking up our groceries in Kelowna on the way through did mean that people were resting their feet on crates of beer.</p>

<p>Big White was a great resort with enough terrain to keep us (beginners) and Jeremy and Kirsty (experts) happy, our <a href="http://www.rentchalets.com/lodge/1071/index.php?action=search&amp;workingAccommodationPage=2&amp;workingMinPerson=9&amp;workingMaxPerson=11">accommodation</a> was excellent and although there aren’t a huge amount of restaurants there was enough to keep us occupied for a week.</p>

<p>From the snowboarding perspective, we had a couple of 2 hour semi-private lessons which were really good. Very high quality and certainly helped us to get the most out of our <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2003/01/les-arcs/">second snowboarding holiday</a>.</p>
