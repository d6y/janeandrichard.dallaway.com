<p>We headed along to the <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/">Brighton Bloggers</a> meet up last night and caught up with <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/">Jeremy</a>, <a href="http://assistantbrighton.blogspot.com/">Jonathan</a> and <a href="http://www.bedsitbomber.com/index.jsp">Andrew</a>. <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/">Jeremy</a> and his band <a href="http://www.saltercane.com/">Salter Cane</a> were playing at the Hanbury Ballroom as part of <a href="http://www.thegildedpalaceofsin.com/shows2004/brightonlive_preview.htm">Brighton Live week</a>.</p>

<p>It was a free event organised by the <a href="http://www.thegildedpalaceofsin.com/">Gilded Palace of Sin</a> and was a really good evening. The first band on were <a href="http://www.homescience.co.uk/">Homescience</a> – <em>“An unashamed pop band of maximum jangle”</em>, the second were <a href="http://www.threewheeler.i12.com/">Threewheeler</a> – <em>“a quartet making a totally unorthodox, utterly unique music”</em> and finishing with <a href="http://www.saltercane.com/downloads/">Salter Cane</a> – <em>“an amalgam of NICK CAVE in gospel mode, WILLARD GRANT CONSPIRACY at their most dramatic, SIXTEEN HORSEPOWER’s lyrical darkness and the heaviness of JOY DIVISION”</em>.</p>
