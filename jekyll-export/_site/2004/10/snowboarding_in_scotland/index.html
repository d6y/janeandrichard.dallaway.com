<p>I found <a href="http://www.highland-instinct.co.uk/index.html">Highland-Instinct</a> today through <a href="http://www.goneboarding.co.uk/">GoneBoarding</a>. A great site reporting on the <a href="http://www.highland-instinct.co.uk/scottishskicentres.htm">snow conditions and ski resorts</a> in Scotland. Shame that the <a href="http://www.skiclub.co.uk/skiclub/reports/historical/report.asp">SkiClub historical snow reports</a> arenâ€™t more favourable. Still, it might be worth a trip up if it looks like a good season this year and it would save another trip to <a href="/2004/09/we_were_at_milton">Milton Keynes Xscape</a>.</p>
