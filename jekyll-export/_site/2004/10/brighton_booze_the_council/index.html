<p>Brighton booze: The council have OKed <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/3725004.stm">24-hour drinking</a>, while the headline of the Argus is that the Sussex <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/the_argus/news/NEWS0.html">Police chief attacks 24-hour drinking</a>.</p>

<p>The Argus headline is a little misleading, because the Sussex chief constable is actually against <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,11026,1323972,00.html">the sale of cheap alcohol</a>, and would rather have tax income to help pay for the policing of binge drinking. That’s the same binge drinking that the council is hoping to control with the <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/site01.cfm?request=c1134081">new 24-hour licensing</a>. </p>

<p>The first licenses will come into effect late in 2005, so it looks like we’re in for an interesting, experimental, summer in 2006…</p>
