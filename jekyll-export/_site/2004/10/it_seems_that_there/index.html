<p>It seems that there won’t be any <a href="http://www.brightonbears.com/news/news_detail.asp?news_id=763">European Brighton Bears games this season after a sponsor pulled out</a>. Shame, I was looking forward to the odd Tuesday evening euro league match.</p>

<p>We went to see the <a href="http://www.brightonbears.com/news/news_detail.asp?news_id=746">Bears v Sharks</a> match the other weekend at the Triangle, taking our 8 year old nephew with us – he seemed to really enjoy the whole occasion, so I suspect we’ll end up taking him to another game this <a href="http://www.brightonbears.com/fixtures/fixtures.asp">season</a>.</p>
