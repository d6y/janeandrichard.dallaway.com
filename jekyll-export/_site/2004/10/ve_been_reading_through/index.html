<p>I’ve been reading through the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1900916126/richarddallaway">World Snowboarding Guide</a> 2004 (online <a href="http://www.worldsnowboardguide.com/">here</a>) to track down some likely looking places for snowboarding trips next year. Whilst looking for a piste map I came across <a href="http://www.skimaps.com/">SkiMaps.com</a> which has a good collection of maps. I’m planning to use it to help me work out a) how many <a href="http://skilifts.org/glossary.htm">drag lifts/t-bars</a> I’m going to have to negotiate to get around the mountain and b) how many easy/intermediate runs there are.</p>

<p>And whilst talking about winter holidays, I noticed that there is an interesting article over at <a href="http://travel.guardian.co.uk/activities/wintersports">Guardian Winter Sports</a> about how to <a href="http://travel.guardian.co.uk/activities/wintersports/story/0,7447,1317867,00.html">package your trip online</a> which looks to have some interesting links. I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/">The Independent</a> at the weekend and their <a href="http://travel.independent.co.uk/themes/skiing/">ski section</a> had a couple of links to tailor-made trip organisers – <a href="http://www.ski-i.com/">Ski Independence</a>, <a href="http://www.skisafari.com/">Ski Safari</a> and <a href="http://www.momentum.uk.com/">Momentum Ski</a> – all of which look pretty useful for road trips.</p>
