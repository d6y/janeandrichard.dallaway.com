<p>We went to see the <a href="http://www.brightoncomedyfestival.com/theperrierawardshow.asp">Perrier Comedy Awards show in Brighton</a> last night. It was compared by <a href="http://www.funny.co.uk/stand-up-comedy/art_62-2404-Adam-Hills.html">Adam Hills</a>, and starred <a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/whodgson.html">Will Hodgson</a> (winner of the 2004 Best newcomer), <a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/skendall.html">Sarah Kendall</a> (a nominee), <a href="http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/news.cfm?id=1007222004">Jackson’s Way</a> (winner of the 2004 Perrier Comedy Award) and finished off with non-perrier nominee <a href="http://www.marcusbrigstocke.com/">Marcus Brigstocke</a> (who was filling in for Reginald D Hunter).</p>

<p>Jackson’s Way and Marcus Brigstocke were excellent, the other two didn’t seem to have the experience to cope with a gig in the <a href="http://www.brighton-dome.org.uk/">Brighton Dome</a> in front of 1000 people. Yet again, I found myself leaving a comedy show feeling that I don’t see half as much live comedy as I should.</p>
