<p>While Liverpool are <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/3758328.stm">getting on with it</a>, we’re still talking about it: the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/3956797.stm">latest survey in Brighton</a> say 80% favour a smoking ban in the city (n=3700). </p>

<p>The government have pretty much ruled out a national ban for now, so this means Liverpool (and other councils) will need to ask <a href="http://www.parliament.uk">Parliament</a> to implement local laws. In the case of Liverpool, it’s the Prohibition of Smoking in Places of Work Bill. I’ve not yet found the text of the bill, but it’ll probably be introduced as a Private Member’s Bill by the end of November. </p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1324186,00.html">Times</a> “many of England’s biggest cities and nearly 50 councils are lining up behind Liverpool to back a ban on smoking”. In fact, a join bill from the London boroughs will also be presented this year to allow any London borough to put in place a similar ban. With this sort of pressure surely there will eventually be national legislation.</p>

<p>For now, it’ll still take 12-18 months for the local laws to be passed. This might be one of those <a href="http://www.faxyourmp.com/">fax your mp</a> moments.</p>
