<p>Last night we went to the <a href="http://www.cafesci-brighton.org.uk/">Brighton</a> <a href="http://www.cafescientifique.org/">Cafe Scientifique</a> at <a href="http://www.the-terraces.co.uk/">Terraces Bar and Grill</a>. <a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/">Simon Singh</a> was the guest speaker, all about the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007152515/richarddallaway">Big Bang</a>. Despite there being a lot of people there, and the acoustics/lack of microphone making it hard to hear at times it was a very good talk, explaining the facts and theories in a really accessible manner – the way I wish I’d been taught science at school (rather than my physics teacher at senior school announcing that “as far as I’m concerned women are only here to give pleasure to me and give birth to my children and I don’t see why I should teach them physics”).</p>
