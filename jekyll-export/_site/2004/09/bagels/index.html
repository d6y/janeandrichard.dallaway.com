<p>I made my first <a href="http://www.pastrywiz.com/archive/whatisa.htm">bagels</a> yesterday – and they turned out to be a success. We’ve had a <a href="http://www.morphyrichards.co.uk/index.pl?REFID=7cffHHj5tY0ccA58TY7x67999%t7BYq7FTy600wrwtfp8oeusjjei54548ertytsafgw47&amp;ORPGM=productOverview&amp;ORPGT=perl&amp;ORPRD=48285&amp;ORGRP=R12&amp;ORCAT=SR01&amp;ORLID=ENG">bread maker</a> for 2 years now, and have progressed from <a href="http://www.wrightsflour.co.uk/pages/clubnew/breadmachine.htm">pre-mixed bread-mixes</a>, through the <a href="http://www.morphyrichards.co.uk/wizz400/downloads/InstructionBooklets/IB48285.PDF">recipes that came with the machine</a>, to those in a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/202-1190729-4960659">recently bought book</a>. Yesterday I attempted my first “internet” bread recipe – <a href="http://recipeview.com/Bagels/Bagels2.htm">for bagels</a>. I had to adjust the recipe slightly as I didn’t have any Barley malt syrup or Molasses – so I just put them in plain boiling water. They also floated the moment I put them in, but <a href="http://www.recipe-ideas.co.uk/recipes-1/Bagels%20(Breadmaker).htm">this recipe</a> suggests “cooking for about 30 seconds on each side” which is similar to how long I boiled them.</p>
