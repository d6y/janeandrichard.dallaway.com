<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3673568.stm">Brian Clough died today</a>. Cloughy was my Grandmother’s favourite football manager, and always one she respected, and used in a “Cloughy wouldn’t have done that” kind of way. This was of great amusement to my Father as he used this to wind her up on all possible occasions. I still don’t know why my Gran was a <a href="http://www.nottinghamforest.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Home">Nottingham Forest</a> fan as she lived in Hull and surrounding areas for all of her life, but she was. One of those things I guess.</p>

<p>There are some great Cloughy quotes at <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=6&amp;click_id=19&amp;art_id=qw1095691862988S163">IOL: Soccer</a> – I guess these are the kind of quotes my Dad liked to remind Gran about.</p>
