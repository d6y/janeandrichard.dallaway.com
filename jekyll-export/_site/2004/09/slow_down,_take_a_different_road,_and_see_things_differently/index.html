<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</a> had a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64776,00.html">story yesterday</a> about a guy <a href="http://www.10mph.com/">Segwaying across the US</a>. Another mad scheme. This one seems to be being done to make a documentary out of – rather than just because they can as he counts a “Writer and independent filmmaker” amongst his 4 strong <a href="http://www.10mph.com/about/team.html">support team</a> and their <a href="http://www.10mph.com/about/">plan</a> states “And when we’re finished, we’ll wrap it up with a feature-length documentary.” This still counts as an adventure in my books though!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my friends <a href="http://www.bigtrip.blogspot.com">Vic and Banz</a> and their friends <a href="http://www.oztrip04.blogspot.com/">Spencer and Cath</a> continue to make good progress in their respective world trips – both sets are travelling from the UK to Australia – Vic and Banz by <a href="http://www.bigtrip.blogspot.com/logistics/sob.html">bi</a><a href="http://www.bigtrip.blogspot.com/logistics/sos.html">ke</a>, Spencer and Cath in a more <a href="http://oztrip04.blogspot.com/backpack/backpacks.html">traditional</a> way.</p>
