<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:medieval">Medieval</a> history… dull dull dull. Except when Terry Jones does it. I only caught the last two episodes of <a href="http://www.bbcfactual.co.uk/terry_jones_medieval_livesl.htm">Medieval Lives</a>, but it was just smashing. Much was learned: Good King Richard I (actually bad); Bad King Richard II (actually good); Hunchback King Richard III (complete fabrication). Or that medieval society was very litigious, spending much time in court rather than, as I probably thought, eating mud or something. </p>

<p>Reading <a href="http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/474/474005p1.html">an interview</a> it looks the whole series would be pretty good.</p>

<p>There’s also <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0563487933/richarddallaway">a book of the series</a>, but I don’t know what that’s like.</p>
