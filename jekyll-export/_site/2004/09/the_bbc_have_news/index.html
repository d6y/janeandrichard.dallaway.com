<p>The BBC have a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3680484.stm">news story about rural transport</a> today, and one of their “Related Internet Links” is for the <a href="http://www.transportdirect.com/">Government guide to public transport</a>. This website allows you to put in your start and end points and travelling time and it will provide you with a list of journey options. Sounds pretty useful.</p>
