<p>To celebrate our second wedding anniversary we decided to head to New York. Armed with the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141010908/richarddallaway">Time Out</a> guide, and the excellent books available from the <a href="http://www.innon23rd.com/">hotel</a> (we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002XM8MI/richarddallaway">Frommers</a> as it had the best maps and restaurant sections), we explored the city in manageable chunks.</p>

<p>One day we explored Fifth Avenue, <a href="http://www.grandcentralterminal.com/">Grand Central</a>, Little Italy and Chinatown. The next we went up the <a href="http://www.esbnyc.com/">Empire State Building</a> and visited Times Square at night. The next day was our anniversary and we spent the day around <a href="http://www.batteryparkcity.org/">Battery Park</a>, <a href="http://groundzero.nyc.ny.us/">Ground Zero</a> and taking a trip on the <a href="http://www.siferry.com/">Staten Island Ferry</a> before going out for a <a href="http://www.newyorkmetro.com/pages/details/2475.htm">wonderful meal</a>. On Wednesday it rained – the tail end of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3625252.stm">hurricane Frances</a> <a href="http://nyt.wieck.com/portal/wieck_preview_page_156821">hit town</a> – and our <a href="http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/index.jsp?c_id=nyy">Yankees</a> game was cancelled, still we found a <a href="http://www.in-newyorkmag.com/profiles/zocalo_profile.htm">good restaurant</a> to get over our disapointment in. Our last day saw us heading over to <a href="http://www.centralpark.org/">Central Park</a> and taking a great walk before heading back off to Fifth Avenue for the last of the shopping. Our final evening we headed to the Hotel Metro and sat out on their (understated) <a href="http://www.hotelmetronyc.com/phototour7.html#">roof terrace</a> looking up at the Empire State building (one block away).</p>

<p>A great trip, and we’ve left ourselves things to do should we get a chance to go back (like visit the <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/">Guggenheim</a> when it’s open as well as many other museums and galleries).</p>
