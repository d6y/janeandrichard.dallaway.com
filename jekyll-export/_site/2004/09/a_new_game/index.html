<p>Inspired by our trip to NY, here’s a new game you can play anytime you buy anything. The objective of the game is to have the last word when ending a transaction, with a secondary aim of scoring as many points as possible, with a point won each time either you or the shop person says something.</p>

<p>An example of how not to play… let’s say you’ve just handed over payment and been given a receipt:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You: Thank you.</li>
  <li>Shop person: You’re welcome.</li>
  <li>(you leave the store)</li>
</ol>

<p>You lose: you didn’t have the last word, and it’s a short exchange anyway. Let’s try again:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You: Thank you.</li>
  <li>Shop person: You’re welcome. </li>
  <li>You: (smile expectantly)</li>
  <li>Shop person: Have a nice day.</li>
  <li>You: And you have a nice day too.</li>
  <li>Shop person: Why thanks.</li>
  <li>You: You’re welcome.</li>
  <li>(you leave the store)</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes! You win, and you score 6 points. Good work.</p>
