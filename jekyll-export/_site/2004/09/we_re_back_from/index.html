<p>We’re back from a trip to New York. I’ll just mention one thing before I forget: the crossing signs on the streets spoke (not so unusual in itself) but it was more like a song. We got “Wait… Wait…. Wait…. Sixth Avenue! Walk sign is on to cross Sixth Avenue. Sixth Avenue! Walk sign is on …”. There’s something about the pause between “cross” and “Sixth Avenue” that made it flow so well. There’s an example <a href="http://www.walkinginfo.org/aps/audio/9custom1.wav">WAV sample of something similar</a> you can listen to, but it’s much too flat – not the same at all. We should have recorded it. </p>
