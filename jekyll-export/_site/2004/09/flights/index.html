<p>On our trip to New York we flew with 2 different airlines, using 2 different UK airports. We left <a href="http://www.baa.co.uk/main/airports/gatwick/">Gatwick</a> on <a href="http://www.continental.com">Continental</a> and returned to <a href="http://www.baa.co.uk/main/airports/heathrow/">Heathrow</a> on <a href="http://www.virgin-atlantic.com">Virgin</a> – this gave us a pretty good opportunity to compare the service provided.</p>

<p>The service on Virgin was much better, including bringing around ice creams half way through the flight, but Continental was adequate, they weren’t rude or inattentive or anything. The <a href="http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/en/gb/whatsonboard/inflightentertainment/index.jsp">entertainment on Virgin</a> was again better, having a decent selection of films/TV/radio, whilst Continental had a <a href="http://www.continental.com/travel/inflight/entertainment/films/mca_grid_200409.pdf">lot less options</a>. The legroom was far and away better on Continental. I’m not especially tall, but when a heavy person sits in front of you and moves around a lot it’s a lot less painful when your knees aren’t actually touching the seat in front. According to <a href="http://www.airlinequality.com/Product/seats_global.htm">Global Airline Seating Guide</a> there is no difference, but on our flights (of course, the different aeroplanes may make a difference, between a <a href="http://www.boeing.com/flash.html">Boeing</a> and an <a href="http://www.airbus.com/dynamic/media/index.asp">Airbus</a>) it felt more like 3 or 4 – quite a noticeable difference.</p>

<p>Update: Just spotted that <a href="http://www.petebarrwatson.com">Pete</a> has blogged on a <a href="http://www.petebarrwatson.com/archives/2004/09/seat_guru_1.html">similar subject</a>, and he found <a href="http://www.seatguru.com/">SeatGuru</a>. SeatGuru also seems to display the legroom per plane model per airline. Mind you, this claims that Virgin should have more legroom than Continental on the specific planes we used which wasn’t our experience.</p>
