<p>I’ve done much more planting than usual this year. Here are the majority of my pots/containers growing wonderfully. The potatoes have been a bit mad. </p>

<p>The bottom right hand corner are my potatoes 9 days before this photo – the potatoes here are again the bottom right hand of the photo. I’m really not sure at what point they prevent me being able to see out of the kitchen window. I’ve marked up this photo with notes explaining what all of the vegetables are.<br clear="all" /></p>
