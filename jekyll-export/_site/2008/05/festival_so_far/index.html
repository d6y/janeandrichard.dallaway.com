<p>It’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Festival">festival time</a>, and although we’re not doing much in the <a href="http://www.brightonfestival.org/">Brighton Festival</a> itself, we have a punishing schedule in the <a href="http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/">Brighton Festival Fringe</a>—which, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Festival_Fringe">I’m told</a>, is the “England’s largest arts event, and the 2008 Fringe is the second largest Fringe Festival in the world”. Citation needed, indeed.</p>

<p>So far we’ve been to…</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/comedy/listing.asp?ev=1440&amp;ed=8903">X-Files Improv</a> with Dean Haglund, who turns out to be the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0353750/">long haired blond geeky one</a> in the X-Files. A small turn out (30 people?), but a huge amount of fun. Essentially, an X-Files episode is created using audience suggestions, and it worked really well. A top act. </li>
  <li>We spent an hour or so of a boiling hot day in <a href="http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/listing.asp?ev=1431&amp;ed=8900">The Last South: Pursuit of the Pole</a>. Yes, there were initial technical issues with the sound, and yes the venue suffered from being on a roundabout on bank holiday Monday with motorcycles roaring passed, but this didn’t distract from a great play. It was Scott and Amundsen on stage, writing their journals, in step with each other, but with very different experiences. Touching, funny, etc. </li>
  <li>Up to the university we dropped in on a <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/alumni/pages/prof_lectures/theodora_duka.html">professorial lecture</a>, namely “<a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/473258/">Alcohol: a simple molecule with complex consequences for emotion and behaviour</a>“. We learned about the experiments on memory and behaviour under the effects of booze, and it was eye-opening. I didn’t know, for example, that drinking enhances your memory (but only for events before the drinking starts). Naturally, there was a wine reception after. </li>
  <li>And tonight we went to see <a href="http://www.brightonfestival.org/Event_Details.aspx?eid=2754">Mike Leigh in conversation with Amy Raphael</a>, discussing his films and watching bits of some of them. We headed back home to sign up to <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com">LoveFilm</a> to get his back catalog. </li>
</ul>

<p>One negative: the £1 per ticket booking fees are evil, especially as the booking system isn’t finished and the web sites are frustrating to use. And on top of that “internet booking fees” should be made illegal. But, there’s no competition, so we pay. I’d rather have to pay than not have it at all, is what it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)">comes down to</a>.</p>
