<p>The <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1120661">Communal Bin Consultation</a> has started in the little bit of Brighton we live in. Potentially a good idea, but I think one to reject. If you’re not sure if you’re affected take a look at the <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/downloads/bhcc/refuse/Existing_and_Proposed_communal_bins_website.pdf">map of the proposed and existing bin locations (PDF)</a>.</p>

<p>We’re told: “The containers will be emptied regularly to prevent them from overflowing. Where we currently have bins we do not have any problems.” Ah come off it… no problems at all? I’ve seen over-flowing bins, and a good percentage of the one’s I’ve seen are broken (as in the photo above). </p>

<p>But anyway… a dull topic… and one that’s been discussed <a href="http://www.regencybrighton.com/issues/bins/2007/10/16/bin-debate/">for a while</a>, and <a href="http://www.davenportdigital.com/category/communal-bins/">rejected by many</a>. It’s just one of <a href="http://www.fixmystreet.com/reports/Brighton+and+Hove">the usual issues</a>.</p>

<p>BTW: there’s a surprising number of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=brighton%20bins&amp;w=all">photos of Brighton bins</a> knocking around.</p>
