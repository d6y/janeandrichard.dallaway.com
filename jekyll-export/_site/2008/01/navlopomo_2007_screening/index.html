<p>This afternoon we spent a couple of hours at <a href="http://www.werkshop.org.uk/space/">The Werks</a> watching the highlights of the <a href="http://nablopomo.ning.com/group/videobloggers">NaVloPoMo</a> 2007 project. Some of the films were funny, some were sad, a lot were well thought out with a story to tell.</p>

<p>I used the video feature on my phone and recorded snippets of the afternoon, which I’ve edited in iMovie as a tribute.</p>

<p>I don’t think I should give up the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/">photography</a> and switch to video any time soon :-). Having said that <a href="http://node101.pbwiki.com/">Node 101</a> is a skill swap style idea to help people learn how to produce video, so if it gets off the ground in Brighton, maybe I should head along.</p>
