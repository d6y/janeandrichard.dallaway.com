<p>I was having a conversation with <a href="http://beautyandruin.com/monkeys/">Alex</a> earlier, and we started talking about collective nouns. My personal favourite is still an “ostentation of peacocks”. We found various online resources (<a href="http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Pointless/AnimalGroups.html">Animal Groups</a>, and of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_collective_nouns_by_subject_A-H">Wikipedia</a> has something to offer) to ponder and discussed how much some of these words really had anything to do with the object being collected – an “aurora of polar bears” for instance.</p>

<p>Wikipedia also offers collective nouns for job types as well, offering among others a sulk of developers. We’d already been thinking of terms for developers, designers, project managers and the other disciplines we have here at <a href="http://www.madgex.com">work</a> and came up with a “creation of designers”, “list of project managers” and the fairly obvious “Victory of Madgexians” (paying homage to the <a href="http://ultimatepubguide.com/pubs/info.phtml?pub_id=151">Madgex Arms</a> of course).</p>

<p>Any suggestions to offer? If so, leave a comment and I’ll try and collate them.</p>
