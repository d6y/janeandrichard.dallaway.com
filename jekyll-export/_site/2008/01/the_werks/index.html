<p>Today is my third day, or part day, working out of <a href="http://werkshop.org.uk/">The Werks</a>. </p>

<p>I’m used to spending most of my week working in my own space, to shouting down the phone as loud as I like, laughing out-loud in video chats, playing music, or having complete silence… all that stuff. So why am I trying out a more open space? </p>

<p>The short answer is, I don’t know. The longer answer is that I have a hunch that there’s something special about a bunch of people in a room. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Princes_of_Serendip">Serendipity</a> is the word I’m looking for and it’s a good match to The Werks: “Werkshop is a new concept which aims to provide a supportive environment for new ideas.” </p>

<p>So it’s going to take me a while to adjust, which is why I’m determined to make the effort to get down to The Werks as regularly as I can in January. Only then will I be in a position to judge the merits of being out there…. although, in part, it depends on who else shows up. </p>

<p>In terms of facilities, I can’t see anything missing: internet, electricity, lighting, desks, chairs, coffee, water, doors, windows, cycle parking… it’s all there, it’s been thought about, it all works, it’s all good. It’s not the centre of Brighton, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hove">actually</a> the location is great. </p>

<p>It’s exactly the kind of space a few of us have been talking about for a while, so I’m delighted it exists and is working so well.</p>

<p>Each Friday in January is open to anyone. I thought <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/399483">the first one</a> worked out really well: I certainly enjoyed it. Look for <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/venue/99520/">the event on Upcoming</a> and try it out.<br clear="all" /></p>
