<p>This is a test movie I put together so I could discover how to use the 16:9 setting on the camera, to see how to edit with 16:9, and how to export it. I also wanted to see how I‚Äôd get on hand-holding the camera on a cycle.</p>

<p>It turned out to be a great lesson, but unfortunately a terrible piece of video. Sorry about that. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned‚Ä¶ </p>

<p>In the first half of the film I was cycling with the camera resting on the handlebars, using my right hand to press the camera onto the handle bars. This is bad for two reason: first, I couldn‚Äôt signal in traffic to turn right; second, the vibrations from the road through the camera has crippling effects on the recording. </p>

<p>Later I was cycling essentially one handed, which produced smoother film. It also allowed me to try out changing the filming angle. </p>

<p>Other stuff: cycling against a strong wind, while filming, resulting in me wheezing. Combined with the occasional loud sniff makes for some horrible sound. Gah. But it was a good exercise for me in blending and offsetting the sound from different clips‚Äîmore so later in the sequence than earlier. Oh, and I learned that I need to oil my cycle: some of the squeaks and rattling sounds are embarrassing üôÇ </p>

<p>But that aside the 16:9 part kind of works. I had to jump through a few hoops to export the movie into iDVD. Although the 16:9 export from FCE has the right aspect ratio in QuickTime player, it imports to iDVD as 3:4. I don‚Äôt have QuickTime Pro, so I couldn‚Äôt use the <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305337">official Apple workaround</a> for this, or <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sith33/FileSharing34.html">Anamorphicizer</a>, so to get round it I had to pull the movie into iMovie08 and then export from that. It works.</p>

<p>Initially I was deeply unhappy with the output, especially when viewed on TV. Then I found the ‚ÄúDeinterlace Source Video‚Äù checkbox in the size option box from ‚ÄúFile/Export QuickTime Conversion‚Ä¶‚Äù (which is where I also picked ‚ÄúPAL 720√ó576 16:9‚Äù for the dimensions). Lots of jaggies in the original, all gone when deinterlaced. </p>

<p>The version here is a result of exporting from iMovie08 using the ‚ÄúShare/Export Movie‚Äù menu, and picking the ‚Äúmedium‚Äù format.</p>
