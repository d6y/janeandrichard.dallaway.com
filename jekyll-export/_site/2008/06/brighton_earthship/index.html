<p>I attended a talk several years ago about the <a href="http://earthship.net/">Earthship</a> concept, and have been meaning to join one of the <a href="http://www.lowcarbon.co.uk/tours">regular tours</a> to the <a href="http://www.lowcarbon.co.uk/">Brighton Earthship</a> but just never got around to it. When I spotted the tour as part of the <a href="http://www.ecoopenhouses.org/index.html">eco Open Houses</a> it just seemed too good an opportunity to miss.</p>

<p>I found it hard to justify driving to Stanmer Park to go and visit an eco property, so we got the bikes out and pedalled off to Stanmer House where the group assembled. There were probably around 80 people so we split into two groups and <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/workoutdetail/index.do?id=267304">walked</a> off through the <a href="http://www.lowcarbon.co.uk/earthship-brighton/stanmer-organics">Stanmer Organics</a> plots towards the Earthship.</p>

<p>As John, the tour guide, was telling us all about the building process, and how the earthship works, I got to wondering if there were any you could stay in anywhere. My question was answered inside as there was a leaflet – “<a href="http://earthship-france.com/">Eco Home Holiday Rental – the house that runs itself</a>” – in Ger, Normandy, France. Sounds like a great way to experience “off the grid” living without committing to it for the long-term.</p>
