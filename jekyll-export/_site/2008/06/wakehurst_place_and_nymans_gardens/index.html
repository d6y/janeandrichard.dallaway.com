<p>Last weekend we headed off to <a href="http://www.kew.org/places/wakehurst/index.html">Wakehurst Place</a>, a botanic garden and conservation area managed by the <a href="http://www.kew.org/">Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew</a>. Wakehurst Place was added to my to-visit list earlier this year when it was mentioned at a <a href="http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/">Cafe Scientifique</a> talk about <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/208221/">The Flower Hunters</a>. It wasn’t the sunniest day, but it was warm and dry and we spent a <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/workoutdetail/index.do?id=215662">good few hours walking around the gardens</a>. We didn’t manage to get around all of it, and in fact missed almost all of the <a href="http://www.kew.org/places/wakehurst/zone_woodland.html">Woodland zone</a> – a good reason to return.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the <a href="http://www.kew.org/places/wakehurst/zone_conservation.html">Conservation zone</a> and walking along the raised walkway above the water. At the end of the day, and after reading a few leaflets, and finding out that we’d get our admission fee back, we decided to join the <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-index.htm">National Trust</a> for the year – we have a weekend in the Isle of Wight and a week in Cornwall later in the year and so hope we will be able to make a lot of use of it.</p>

<p>This weekend we took advantage of our new National Trust membership and visited <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-nymansgarden2/">Nyman’s</a> – the closest National Trust property to our house (I think!) and had a very pleasant afternoon. Nymans has gardens, woodland and amazing views over Sussex and it seems to be a really great space – people were picnicking, playing hide and seek, sitting on the plentiful benches reading the Sunday paper – a really, really welcoming area. We had a <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/workoutdetail/index.do?id=230651">short walk around</a> and I’m looking forward to an opportunity to return and do some of the woodland walks and possibly even a visit to the house to take a look at the family rooms.</p>
