<p>So the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/fixtures/default.stm">fixtures are out for Hull’s first season in the Premiership</a> and it starts with a home game against Fulham. As Richard pointed out, I should take a screen shot of the table now, as we’re currently 8th, so here we are, recorded for posterity 🙂</p>

<p>Being the geek that I am, I’ve used the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/fixtures/default.stm">BBC fixtures link</a>, some <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> macro generation, a bit of Excel date manipulation and some hand crafted code to generate a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/downloads/iCal/HullCityFixtures.ics">Hull City Fixtures</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> file.<br />
There are no guarantees I’ll keep it up to date, but to the best of my knowledge it is correct today</p>
