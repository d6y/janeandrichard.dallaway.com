<p>In 2006 <a href="/2006/09/geek_heritage">we visited Bletchly Park</a>, and I really recommend you head out there sometime. In fact, go <strong>soon</strong>, because we found out at <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/297388/">the Cafe Sci talk</a> that they have three years left of funding. Then… it’s gone. </p>

<p>Yesterday I received <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/516816">a press release</a> which contained some worrying images of building decay. But there’s something you can do…</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can sign the petition lobbying the Prime Minister to act to help preserve Bletchley Park: <a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/BletchleyPark/">http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/BletchleyPark/</a>.</li>
  <li>You can visit. We were lucky and went <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622636780133/">on a special day</a>, so check out <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/calendar/futureEvents.rhtm?cat=special">the list of events</a>. The train station is <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=8958416784856176403,51.995504,-0.737427&amp;saddr=Unknown+road+%4051.995504,+-0.737427&amp;daddr=51.996851,-0.738337&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=17&amp;sll=51.996349,-0.738026&amp;sspn=0.004003,0.007875&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=17">more-or-less across the road</a> from Bletchly Park, so it’s easy to get to. </li>
  <li>If you want, you can <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/shop/changeDonate.rhtm/-1">donate</a>.</li>
</ul>
