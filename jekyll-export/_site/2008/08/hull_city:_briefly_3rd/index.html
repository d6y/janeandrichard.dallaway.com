<p>On Saturday afternoon <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/default.stm">Hull City</a> were briefly 3rd in the Premiership. I posted a picture when <a href="/2008/06/hull_city_fixtures_2008/09">we were 8th</a> (pre-season) but here we are, one game in, and we’ve exceeded the pre-season position. Even after the weekend games, we’re still 5th.</p>
