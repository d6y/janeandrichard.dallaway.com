<p>I <a href="/2008/09/couch_to_5k">mentioned a few weeks ago</a> that I’d taken up running. Since that post I’ve managed to run 5K on a couple of occasions, and I’ve also done some interval training. I’ve decided to enter a <a href="http://www.brightonphoenix.org.uk/phoenixraces.asp">3.8K race on the 9th November 2008</a> in Preston Park, Brighton and this seems like a great opportunity to raise some money for the <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/index.php">Alzheimers society</a>. As most of my friends know my Mum was diagnosed with dementia in November 2001 and I know firsthand how hard this illness can be for both the patient and the friends and family who watch the slow decline in brain function. This is the first time I’ve blogged about this, and my main reason now is to ask you to <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/janedallaway">sponsor me</a>. I make no promises about the speed I’ll do the run – the course record is under 12 minutes, but I don’t think I’ll be causing the record holder any worries – finishing it will be achievement enough for me.</p>
