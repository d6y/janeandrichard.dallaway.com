<p>I took this photo in the grounds of the <a href="http://www.silvermt.com/Lodging/default.aspx?page=Lodging">Morning Star Lodge</a> near the <a href="http://www.silvermt.com/">Silver Mountain</a> Gondola station in Kellogg, Idaho with the sole intention of posting it to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/stickfiguresinperil/">Stick Figures in Peril group</a>. This I duly did and someone added a tag of Mr Ouch. I was curious about this and so looked at <a href="http://icanhaz.com/mrouch">all photos tagged with Mr Ouch</a> and discovered that they are all the same peril picture but with different text, instructions and warnings â€“ a sub domain of stick figures in peril.</p>

<p>I will now be on the lookout for other Mr Ouch warning signs to add to the collection.<br clear="all" /></p>
