<p>Forget the religion aspect: this is an absolute gem.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, in Hull, Jane was introduced to the vicar who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism">christened</a> her. That seems a pretty rare event to me, but extraordinarily Jane’s christening was broadcast on the radio.</p>

<p>In 1972 <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/humber/local_radio/">BBC Radio Humberside</a> were running a show called “In His Name”, and their broadcast of 15 October 1972 was from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=113137619056024517968.00045ebb06a0445e397d9">the church in Hull</a> on the day Jane was being christened.</p>

<p>Back at Jane’s parent’s house we found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_cassette">C90 cassette</a> that the station manager had recorded of the show. So, gather round, feel the full quality hiss of the tape: 36M <a href="http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/audio/1972/InHisName.mp3">MP3 version</a> (or 35M <a href="http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/audio/1972/InHisName.ogg">Ogg format</a>, for you freedom lovers).</p>
