<p>Tuesday, at <a href="http://fivepoundapp.com/">£5 App</a>, <a href="http://www.glennjones.net">Glenn</a> gave his personal view of the history of his <a href="http://madgex.com/">company</a>: <em>The idea, name, table football, money, cake and the culture</em>. The most interesting parts for me were his description of using scale to escape the for hire rollercoster (if you’re working as an agency), the importance of having a shared set of values, and using money as a tool. </p>

<p>Interesting stuff. It’ll take a while for it to sink in for me, but as <a href="http://www.ribot.co.uk/">Ribot</a> caught <a href="http://qik.com/video/51892">the talk on video (part 1)</a> (and <a href="http://qik.com/video/51913">part 2</a>) you can judge for yourself.</p>
