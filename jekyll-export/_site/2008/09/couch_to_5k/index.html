<p>I’ve prepared an email with these details in a couple of times now, so I thought I’d put it on here for easy reference.</p>

<p>I started jogging 9 or so weeks ago, and decided to follow the <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml">Couch to 5K programme from Cool Running</a>. With the exception of the week when I was on holiday, I’ve ran 3 days per week and this morning completed Week 8 Day 2. I ran for 28 minutes non-stop, and covered <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2287523">4.1 kilometers</a>.</p>

<p>One of the main helpers in my ability to do this have been the podcasts – I don’t have a watch that works at the moment, and the thought of pulling my phone out and second watching to work out when I should run and when I should walk (at least in the early weeks) held no appeal – so I’ve been using <a href="http://www.ullreys.com/robert/Podcasts/page4/files/category-7.html">Robert Ullrey’s C25K Podcasts</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been using twitter to record my progress since Week 3 for both distance and feelings – you can <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23c25k+janefoth">take a look here</a>.</p>

<p>By the end of next week I should be able to run for 30 minutes without stopping, and should be approaching that 5K mark. Now I just have to find a 5K race to compete in – the only runs I can find at the moment seem to be 8K or 10K which is somewhat out of my reach at the moment.</p>
