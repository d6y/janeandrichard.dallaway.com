<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="/2008/10/sponsor_me?">blogged</a> about my intention to run the <a href="http://www.brightonphoenix.org.uk/">Brighton Phoenix</a> Preston Park 3.8k to <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/janedallaway">raise money</a> for the <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/">Alzheimer’s Society</a>. Well, that was today, and I’m still in one piece. I had some excellent supporters, both family and friends, cheering me around the park and have a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157608794795145/">collection of photos</a> taken by my Father In Law and by Richard. So, here’s the story:</p>

<p>We arrived at Preston Park in time to watch the Men’s race start at 2pm and my first job was to go and collect my number.</p>

<p>We lined up at 3pm, and were ready to go and I was amongst a lot of club runners — I’d say at least 75% of the participants were associated to some club or other. This was somewhat intimidating.</p>

<p>The race was twice around the park. The majority of the runners had gone off at a speed far quicker than I could keep up with so I let them go, but I think I was still running a bit faster than my usual pace. About three quarters of the way around the circuit, Richard took the following photo.</p>

<p>A futher circuit and I managed to overtake someone just before the final stretch and finished as strongly as I possibly could doing the race in 21 minutes and 50 seconds according to my <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/workoutdetail/index.do?id=520470">GPS trace</a>. This was a couple of minutes quicker than my practice run a few weeks ago, so I was delighted with myself.</p>

<p>Only the top 32 times were listed today, but apparently the rest of the results will be available on the website during the week. I’ll post my final time when I know it. I enjoyed the race, well I enjoyed the race being over, and having a good excuse to eat cake :-). The race marshalls around the course were great, and always had a word of encouragement, as did the other supporters around the park, all of which made a big difference.</p>

<p>Finally a big, big thank you to everyone who sponsored me to do this run: you really helped me to keep getting up and out there for a run when the mornings have got colder. As I write this I’ve raised £575. According to the fundraiser’s pack that the Alzheimer’s society sent me this helps as follows: </p>

<ul>
  <li>£100 pays for eight calls to be answered by our helpline and for a pack of essential information to be sent to people in need of advice</li>
  <li>£500 pays for 65 hours of a support worker’s time, to help people with dementia understand their diagnosis and help them take part in activities they enjoy</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks!</p>
