<p>It is now 2 weeks since <a href="/2008/11/preston_park_3.8k_run">the race</a>, and yesterday I wrote a cheque for the cash sponsorship and sent it off to the <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/">Alzheimer’s Society</a>. Between the online and offline sponsors, I managed to raise £625, a figure I’m really, really pleased with, so Thank you all again. Not bad for 21 minutes and 42 seconds worth of activity (if you exclude the training that is!) – it works out at 48p per second.</p>

<p>I suspect I will do another race at some point (so start making your excuses to avoid sponsoring me again now), but at the moment I’m trying to work out whether to continue my training to get faster at doing a distance I know I can do (5K) or whether to increase my target towards doing a 10K. All advice welcomed.</p>
