<p>Ever wondered what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewes#Lewes_bonfire">Bonfire night in Lewes</a> is like? Well, unfortunately, this isn’t going to help that much. I arrived very late, wandered through part of the town to meet some friends in a pub, and then we headed out to one of the bonfires to see the fireworks. On the way back, we bumped into another one of the parades which was heading out to another one of the bonfires. </p>

<p>Apologies for my first experiments using <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/soundtrackpro/">Soundtrack</a> for the “music”.</p>
