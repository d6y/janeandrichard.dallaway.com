<p>For a while I’ve been meaning to record an entire lift run at a ski resort.</p>

<p>On <a href="/2007/03/weekend-snowboarding-at-sierra-nevada/">a trip to Sierra Nevada last March</a>, Jane decided to make the recording — presumably because she was bored of me mentioning it and forgetting to</p>

<p>do it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately she picked the longest lift run at <a href="http://www.andalucia.co.uk/channels/sierra_nevada/sierranevadapistemap/">the resort</a>. The original video</p>

<p>sequence was a finger chilling 10min 11sec, but you’ll be glad to know it’s been sped up here to just 2:10. There’s no sound on this clip, in case you were wondering if your sound was turned all the way down.</p>

<p>The only feature of interest here is that there’s a [radio telescope</p>

<p>at the top of a hill](http://www.osn.iaa.es/osn_eng.html). When riding with that in the background, you half</p>

<p>expect James Bond bad guys with automatic weapons to start chasing you on skidoos. Well, I do.</p>
