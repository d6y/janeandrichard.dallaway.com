<p>A week or so ago, iTunes offered an episode of “<a href="http://www.atowncalledpanic.tv/">A Town called Panic</a>” as a free download. I downloaded, watched, laughed and then bought the series (Note: it can be watched for free <a href="http://www.atom.com/channel/channel_aardman/">here</a>). It is bizarre, and amusing and I love that horse sounds like Bernard Manning.</p>
