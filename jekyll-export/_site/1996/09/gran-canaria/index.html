<p><strong>September 1996</strong></p>

<p>This was a “between jobs” holiday and as so was booked about a week before we left the UK. The hotel was okay, we were on half board and the food was a selection of hot buffet dishes, it was okay but nothing special.</p>

<p>We spent a lot of time just lazing in the sun, and the there were 2 pools, one for swimming, and one plunge pool, with a slide (great fun). The vilage of Playa del Cura is not very far away</p>

<p>from Puerto Rico, but doesn’t have a huge selection of bars or restaurants.</p>

<p>We went on three trips with the operator. The first was to one of the Water parks, which was great fun. Lots of slides and the like. It was a gorgeous day as well. The second trip was going pony trekking, which again was great. This included a barbeque meal afterwards and the food was okay but nothing really special. The third trip was going on a pub crawl around Puerto Rico, which turned out to be quite a laugh, but we didn’t stay until the end.</p>

<p>Overall opinion: it’s quieter than Puerto Rico, and some of the hotels which the operator were offering in Puerto Rico were at the top of a big hill so more convenient in that way.</p>
