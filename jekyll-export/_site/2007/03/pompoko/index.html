<p>This evening we wanted some quick, but tasty food, and so decided to give <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/whatson/fooddrink/pompoko/">Pompoko</a>, a newly opened Japanese cafe in Church Street, a try. It has a counter service, and the food was delivered really quickly. Richard won on his choice of main course, having the Oyako Don (Soya poached egg with fried chicken) which was really lovely. I opted for the Pork Shouga Yaki Don (Pork marinated with honey, ginger and soya sauce) which was tasty and cooked to perfection, but just not as flavoursome as the Oyako Don. They do a takeaway menu as well, and I can see that this could become a bit of a regular “quick stop” for us.</p>
