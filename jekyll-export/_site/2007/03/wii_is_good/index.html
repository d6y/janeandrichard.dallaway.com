<p>I’m just here to confirm what you already know: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a> is good. Good enough so that, on a sunny Sunday, with three FA cup games on TV, the family managed to spent 5hr 30min playing games on it. Good enough to cause my father to exclaim “Oh no, I’ve missed the <a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermonkeyballbananablitz/review.html">banana</a>“. Mind you, we all said that.</p>

<p>What does it for me is the social gaming combined with the physical elements of the games. But, with my geek hat on, I also have to say it’s one of those landmark things, like the PalmPilot, TiVo, P800, Mac OS X, and probably the iPhone: it’s not that you have to have it; it’s more that you can’t justify not buying it, because of the advance it represents.</p>
