<p>We went to see <a href="http://www.shinytoyguns.com/">Shiny Toy Guns</a> at <a href="http://www.pressurepoint.me.uk/second.html">The Pressure Point</a> this evening. Their track “Don’t Cry Out” was featured on the <a href="/2007/01/follow_me_around">Follow Me Around</a> snowboard dvd by <a href="http://www.mackdawgproductions.com/">Mack Dawg Productions</a> and as we loved the sound of them, we trotted off to HMV and bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Are-Pilots-Shiny-Toy-Guns/dp/B000HXDETE/ref=pd_ka_1/203-9350751-6365568?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1173741706&amp;sr=8-1/richarddallaway">album</a>. After a bit more surfing we discovered that they were coming to Brighton as part of their <a href="http://www.shinytoyguns.com/takinglives/">hectic UK and European tour</a> so we headed off, and had an excellent evening, first being rocked by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/vivamachine">Viva Machine</a> and then being hugely entertained by Shiny Toy Guns. I can’t believe that it has taken me over 5 years living in Brighton to attend a gig at The Pressure Point!</p>
