<p>Jim and Lucy had shown interest in trying snowboarding, and as they own a <a href="http://www.lacasadelolivar.com/">property</a> in Southern Spain the <a href="http://www.sierranevadaski.com/home">Sierra Nevada</a> seemed like a good choice.</p>

<p>As beginners this was almost the perfect resort for Jim and Lucy as the Borreguiles area is really well set out with 6 different green runs served by 3 different lifts. We spent a couple of hours getting them started before heading off to see what the resort had to offer us. There wasnâ€™t a lot of challenging terrain available (some areas were closed due to lack of snow or wind) but we had fun none the less.</p>

<p>Favourite run: maribel down to the base</p>
