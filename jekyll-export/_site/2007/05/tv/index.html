<p>When I was in the US a few weeks back, I took my laptop and as a result managed to mostly avoid watching US TV. What I found myself doing was watching a bunch of video podcasts that I had somehow accumulated. Things like <a href="http://www.mobuzz.com/">Mobuzz</a>, <a href="http://www.snowfix.tv/">Snowfix</a> and the currently off-form <a href="http://www.tikibartv.com">Tikibar TV</a>, etc etc <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewGenre?id=26">etc</a>. Although I’ve been subscribed to a bunch of these for a while, what’s creeped up on me is the quality: they’re really good! (I shouldn’t be so surprised). And there’s lots of them.</p>

<p>So when people talk about the nature of TV changing, I’m starting to think they might be right.</p>
