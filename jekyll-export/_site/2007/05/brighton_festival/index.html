<p>Well, it is <a href="http://www.brightonfestival.org/">festival</a> time again here in Brighton, and so today I headed off in search of the <a href="http://www.brightonfestival.org/event_details.aspx?eid=2375">Streets of Brighton</a>, <a href="www.aoh.org.uk/">open houses</a> and <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2007/05/41-places-update.html">more</a> of the <a href="http://41places.org/">41 places</a> installations.</p>

<p>Despite having lived in Brighton for 5 festivals, I’d never ventured into an open house until today – and I’m converted. I visited 3 and found them all to be of a really high standard. The first was <a href="http://www.rodclark.org/">Rod Clark</a>.</p>

<p>The second and third were both down Tidy Street. They were <a href="http://www.robyndillon.co.uk/">Shadow Box</a> and <a href="http://www.square-one.co.uk/openhouse/">SQ1</a>.</p>

<p>I will be visiting more of them. </p>

<p>I managed to catch a few different street performances, the Deep Sea Jivers performed by <a href="http://www.swervyworld.com/jivers.htm">Swervy World</a> and <a href="http://www.desperatemen.com/?p=20">Eco Pirates</a> performed by <a href="http://www.desperatemen.com/">Desperate Men</a>.</p>
