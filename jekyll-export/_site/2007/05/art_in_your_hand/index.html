<p>I read about the <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk">arts council</a>‘s <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/pressnews/press_detail.php?rid=0&amp;sid=&amp;browse=recent&amp;id=838">Art in your hand</a> idea quite a while ago, and applied for one but didn’t really expect to hear anything. Yesterday, however, my new shiny new travel card wallet arrived. A bit different to the usual dull blue plastic. My <a href="https://sales.oystercard.com/oyster/lul/entry.do">Oyster card</a> looks quite at home in it.<br clear="all" /></p>
