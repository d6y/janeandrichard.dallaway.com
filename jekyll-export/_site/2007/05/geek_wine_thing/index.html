<p>Last night we attended the first <a href="http://yandleblog.com/2007/05/innagural-geek-wine-thing.html">Geek Wine Thing</a> organised by <a href="http://yandleblog.com/">Danny</a> and held at the <a href="http://www.rth.org.uk/">Regency Town House</a>.</p>

<p>Henry Butler from the <a href="http://www.butlers-winecellar.co.uk/">Butlers wine cellar</a> led the tasting, and for the cost of a tenner we tasted 8 different Spanish and Portugese wines. As a total novice in the wine tasting world, it was interesting to learn more about how to smell, look at and taste wine. Henry was an excellent and enthusiastic teacher.</p>

<p>The tasting started off very quiet and subdued, but before too many glasses had been consumed we got noisier and noisier.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11369209@N00/511184267/">wines we tasted</a> were:</p>

<p><strong>Whites</strong><br />
Pares Balta Blanc de Pacs 2006 â€“ Spain<br />
Soalheiro Alvarinho 2005 â€“ Portugal<br />
Castello Dâ€™Alba 2005 â€“ Portugal<br />
Navajas Crianza 2003 â€“ Spain</p>

<p><strong>Reds</strong><br />
Monte Real Reserva 2000 â€“ Spain<br />
Clos Le Fites 2002 â€“ Spain<br />
Quinta de la Rosa Tinto 2004 â€“ Portugal<br />
Niepoort Redoma 1994 â€“ Portugal</p>

<p>The white wines were split into unoaked (the first 2) and oaked (the second 2) with one each from Spain and Portugal. As usual I preferred the unoaked â€“ so another nail in the coffin of oaked wines for me.</p>

<p>Next time, and I hope there will be a next time, Iâ€™ll try and remember to bring a pen to make some notes, as somewhat unsurprisingly I donâ€™t remember too much beyond the first couple of glasses ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>As usual, my photos from the evening are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157600252536955/">all on flickr</a>.<br clear="all" /></p>
