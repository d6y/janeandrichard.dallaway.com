<p>I’m back in San Francisco for the JavaOne conference. I think it’s either the 4th or 5th visit to the city. The trip over is something like 10 or 11 hours, and I don’t have a great time on such long flights. Towards the end I was wondering why I put myself through this, but then I snapped out of it and realized what a very lucky boy am I to have the opportunity to go fun places. It’s just a pisser being away from Jane for a week. </p>

<p>Ever since I left the house I’ve had a nagging “I’ve forgotten something” feeling. Somewhere above Canada I realized that it was the snowboards. All the other flights I’ve been on recently have been to snowy places, lugging lots of kit around and it just seems weird to land in a city and not immediately head towards a mountain. </p>

<p>The conference starts tomorrow, so today covered all the usual things such as saying “my body doesn’t work” or “I don’t remember San Fran being this warm” and trying to figure out when to eat and drink to try to flip into the time zone as fast as possible. We’ll be just about right by the time we fly back out.</p>

<p>We’ve picked up all the registration stuff, and had a bit of time shopping. Looking at lobsters (fun), checking out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/487709212/">Sony Reader</a> (impressive screen, but unusable device), wondering who, exactly, needed shark cartilage as a dietary supplement (answer: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_cartilage">nobody</a>), and being overly happy about ordering noodles and being given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything">42</a> as our order number. </p>
