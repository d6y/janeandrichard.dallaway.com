<p>I bought my first ever <a href="http://www.aoh.org.uk/2007/">open house</a> art purchase during this years Brighton Festival. </p>

<p>She is called Valentine and was painted by <a href="http://www.robyndillon.co.uk/sioux/">Sioux Hurman</a>.</p>

<p>I spotted this picture the <a href="/2007/05/brighton_festival">day I first visited</a> the <a href="http://www.robyndillon.co.uk/">Shadow Box Open House</a> in Tidy Street. She is just so vivid and eye catching. I dragged Richard back with me the following week, just to make sure he didn’t hate it and that if I bought it, I could have it on display and not tucked away at the back of a cupboard somewhere… </p>

<p>He approved, I bought her and on Sunday I collected her, and brought her home. She is now happily hanging on the wall in our hallway.<br clear="all" /></p>
