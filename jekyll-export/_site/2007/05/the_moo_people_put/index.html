<p>The <a href="http://www.moo.com/">MOO</a> people put on a great <a href="http://www.moo.com/blog/2007/05/09/a-big-yay-a-big-hello-and-a-big-cake/">party</a>. So, happy 1st birthday to them. Great location, great bar, great deco, great peopleâ€¦ yay. I have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/tags/upcoming%3Aevent%3D172213/">more photos</a> but you really want to see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/upcoming%3Aevent%3D172213/">the photos everyone else took</a>, which were much better.</p>
