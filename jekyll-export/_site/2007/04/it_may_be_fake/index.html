<p>It may be fake, but this weekend The Guardian printed</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2057059,00.html">an article on global warming</a> (Sat 4 April, p. 26) which I like very much. Of course, liking it doesn’t make it right…. </p>

<p>The gist of the article is this: there’s a lot of worry about global warming, and the cause, but “Earth’s resources are finite; the planet is doomed to die […] and the solution is clear: we must seek other planets to colonise. Earth may be good for 10,000 years or so; then it will be time to find a new home, or homes—a literal New World.”</p>

<p>Original? No. I first heard this from the mouth of <a href="http://www.rob-clarkson.com/duff-brewery/bart-quotes.php">Bart Simpson</a>: ” Aw, recycling’s useless Lis. Once the Sun burns out, this planet is doomed. You’re just making sure we spend our last days using inferior products.”</p>

<p>Anyway, the thing about new worlds that troubles me is this: pretty much any planet that’s habitable is going to be inhabited, because life’s like that. So any new world we colonize is going to be one of those SF moves here the aliens come to take over the Earth, except, we’re the bad aliens. More funding for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming">terraforming</a>, I say.</p>
