<p>Last night we went to <a href="http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/">Cafe Scientifque</a> and heard <a href="http://dsg.port.ac.uk/~nicholb/">Bob Nichol</a> talking about cosmology. </p>

<p>It was quite a complex subject to talk about but Bob Nichol was excellent, very engaging, enthusiastic and able to explain things to those of us who haven’t studied science in over 20 years. I’m still too baffled to consider either the supernova that will cause earth to vapourise, or the fact that there might be <a href="http://superstringtheory.com/">11 dimensions</a>. It was also the biggest crowd I’ve seen at a Cafe Sci since it moved to the <a href="http://www.brightonlife.com/brighton/pubs/branch-tavern-33.php">Branch Tavern</a> from the <a href="http://www.the-terraces.co.uk/">Terraces</a>.</p>

<p>It was also good to catch up <a href="http://happygiraffe.net/blog/">Dom</a>, <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/2007/04/dark-energy.html/">Sophie</a> and <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/">Tom</a>.<br clear="all" /></p>
