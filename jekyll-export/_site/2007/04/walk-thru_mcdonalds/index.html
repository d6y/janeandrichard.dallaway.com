<p>During our <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/easter2007/">weekend visit to Hull</a> to see my folks, we took a day trip to Skegness and up the coast past <a href="http://www.anderbycreek.co.uk/">Anderby Creek</a> (which was beautiful) and up to Mablethorpe. In Skegness I spotted this Walk-thru McDonalds â€“ looks like it was originally built as a drive thru.</p>
