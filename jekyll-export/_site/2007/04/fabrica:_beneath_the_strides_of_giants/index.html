<p>We popped into <a href="http://www.fabrica.org.uk/">Fabrica</a> yesterday to see what was on display at the moment and found <a href="http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/artpages/brian_griffiths_beneath1.htm">Beneath the Stride</a> of Giants by Brian Griffiths. It is a wooden boat, made from other people’s junk. </p>

<p>Fabrica is such a lovely place to stop, it’s always peaceful and cool and its often hard to remember it is in such a busy location.<br clear="all" /></p>
