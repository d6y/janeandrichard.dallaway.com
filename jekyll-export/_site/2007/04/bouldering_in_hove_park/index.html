<p>Since <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157600018308647/">Jim broke his wrist</a>, I haven’t been to the <a href="http://www.evolutionindoorclimbing.co.uk/evolution.htm">climbing wall</a>, and I’ve missed it. A couple of weeks ago I stumbled across information that there is a <a href="http://education.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1141162">boulder park in Hove Park</a>, and so today we went for a cycle ride to take a look.</p>

<p>It is about 3 metres high and probably about 12 metres long with areas ranging from scramble, to slight overhangs. We spent half an hour there climbing, traversing and doing the odd scramble. I am really impressed to have something like this so close, and available for free. I’m hoping to start visiting on a weekly basis to have a play.<br clear="all" /></p>
