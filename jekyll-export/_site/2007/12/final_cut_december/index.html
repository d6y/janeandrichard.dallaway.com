<p>Tonight is the December <a href="http://www.finalcut.gb.com/month.html">Final Cut screening at Komedia</a>, and I’ve not had chance to blog about the last one I went to in October. As it starts in an hour and a half, I’ll just quickly say it’s an evening of short films. All sorts of short films: funny, serious, animated, local… I’m not sure if there are any rules. </p>

<p>We primarily went in October to see Dave’s <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=SgZZ3-cVCdk">Work Socks</a>, but I enjoyed every minute of the whole evening. Go to it, it’s good. </p>

<p>Tonight is a Christmas special. With mince pies… but I’m going to miss it. 7:30 at Komedia, £4 on the door.</p>
