<p>Richard and I have spent the last couple of days with his folks in Margate. Weâ€™ve taken a couple of walks with the dog, watched 2 excited great-nephews open their own body weight in presents and munched our way through turkey, sausages, bacon, roast potatoes and plenty of vegetables. Lovely!<br clear="all" /></p>
