<p>We headed off for a quick bike ride today, and ended up getting home 4 hours later after a catalogue of missed turns and optimism that resulted in a 24.5 mile ride. Our first obstacle was getting through the cyclists and spectactors watching the <a href="http://www.urbanrace.co.uk/brighton_triathlon.htm">Triathlon</a>, from then on we were aiming to do a route we used to do quite often, but somewhere along the way we missed our turn and so ended up heading along the South Downs Way for a while. We took a look on the OS map and decided to head towards Southease railway station and catch a train back to Brighton – we even used the power of mobile internet to check that they run on a Sunday. We rolled up at the station (after heading off down the wrong road to Piddinghoe for a mile or so) about 5 minutes before the train was due only to discover that there were maintenance works on the line and they were running a replacement bus service. We didn’t think the bus would like us and our bikes very much and so turned around and headed via Telscombe and back to Brighton stopping at Ovingdean for a slice of cake and a can of fizzy pop.</p>

<p>We <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2007/W20070916112859.kmz">tracked our route</a> using the GPS unit on my Nokia 6110 navigator, and have added it to our collection of <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/">GPS routes</a>.</p>
