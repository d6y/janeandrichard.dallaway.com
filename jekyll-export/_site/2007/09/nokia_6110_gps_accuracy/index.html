<p>I took Jane’s phone on a short cycle ride this morning to see how the <a href="http://research.nokia.com/research/projects/SportsTracker/index.html">Nokia Sports Tracker</a> works when combined with the <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4366035">6110</a>‘s built in GPS. You can dig around <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/W20070904073656.kml">the route on Google Maps</a>.</p>

<p>It’s looking like the accuracy is OK (good enough) when away from buildings; and pretty wonky when in town. It doesn’t have the accuracy of our <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Globalsat-BT338-x-trac-bluetooth-receiver/dp/B00092759S/richarddallaway">Bluetooth GPS unit</a>, but it does have the considerable advantage of being a nice all in one unit.</p>

<p>We’ll give it a go on a snowy mountain: it should be great for tracking a run down a mountain.</p>
