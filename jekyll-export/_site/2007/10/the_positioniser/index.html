<p>Have you read <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a>? Yeah, me too. It’s great, isn’t it? I found it really kicked me over the edge in appreciating the capabilities of getting information across to people in graphs.</p>

<p>Now, the graph below breaks a whole bunch of rules: way too much ink, and.. hello!… what’s that spurious bell curve doing there? But it’s still one hell of a useful diagram.</p>

<p>What I love about the diagram is the way it allows you to hunt-and-peck regions to find boards you might want to try out. For example, it tells me that I need to be over to the left next time I try any boards out.</p>

<p>The diagram is called The Positioniser(TM) and is from last year’s <a href="http://www.fall-line-media.com/snow/">Document Snowboard</a> magazine’s Ultimate Gear Guide supplement (it’s my second favourite snowboard magazine, after <a href="http://www.sukmag.com/">Snowboard UK</a>, but the supplement rocks).</p>
