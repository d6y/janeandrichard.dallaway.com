<p>We managed to attend two snowboard shows over the past couple of weeks – firstly, the <a href="http://www.snowboardshow.co.uk/index.htm">snowboard show</a> at <a href="http://www.snowdome.co.uk/">Tamworth</a> and then the <a href="http://whitelines.com/news/news/the-first-ski-and-snowboard-show-at-snozone-milton-keynes">Sno!Show</a> at <a href="http://www.xscape.co.uk/snow/milton-keynes/whats-inside/snowslope/">Milton Keynes</a>.</p>

      <td>At the Snowboard show we attended a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2007/10/russ-shea.html">talk on photography by Russ Shea</a> before having our first ever rails lesson with Hamish McNight and Stu Edwards. We caught up with <a href="http://www.snowboardcoach.co.uk/ashnewnesprofile.htm">Ash</a> and collected a couple of demo boards he’d brought down for Richard to try, whilst I made the most of the exhibitors and took a <a href="http://www.salomonsnowboard.com/us/products/IVY-1-788748.html">Salomon Ivy</a> and a [Burton Feelgood](http://www.snowboard-asylum.com/cgi-bin/psProdDet.cgi/800931</td>

The Ivy was much twitchier than I’m used to and is a lot more of a handful than <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/03/whilst_we_were_snowboarding">the one I tried in Breckenridge</a> a few years ago, but that could be because it has become more of a freestyle board in the intervening seasons. The Feelgood was lovely, a really enjoyable ride.</td>

      <td>The Sno!Show seemed busier, and had taken over a lot of the snow area of Xscape catering to both skiers and snowboarders. Again I took out a couple of different boards, firstly the <a href="http://www.omaticsnowboards.com/shp.html">omatic</a> [super by Tara Dakides](http://www.snowboard-asylum.com/cgi-bin/psProdDet.cgi/800958</td>

      <td>) and then the <a href="http://www.ridehead.com/#women_boards/1282">Head Fountain</a>. I didn’t find the omatic board very interesting and defnitely not as much fun as my <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/06/ride_kashmir_151">Ride Kashmir</a>. The Head Fountain however I loved – it was really responsive and I spent most of the time riding this with a great big smile on my face.</td>

<p>When I bought my Ride Kashmir 18 months ago I bought it because it was the best board of the 2 I’d been able to hire whilst in Breckenridge. These demo days make so much sense as I’m a firm believer that, at least for me, it isn’t the graphics that matter, it’s the ride style. I tried 2 boards that I wouldn’t have ever dreamt of trying, and one, the Head Fountain, turned out to be a really fun board to ride and one that I’m looking for a good reason to buy to add to the collection :-D. I’m sure I’ll be making the effort to attend this kind of day again to try out more new shiny things…</p>
