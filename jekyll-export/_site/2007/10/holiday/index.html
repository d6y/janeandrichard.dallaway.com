<p>We recently had a week off and spent it exploring more of the UK. We started and ended our trip with visits to <a href="/2007/10/snowboard_shows">snowboard shows</a> – the first at <a href="http://www.snowdome.co.uk/">Tamworth Snowdome</a>, the second at <a href="http://www.xscape.co.uk/snow/milton-keynes/whats-inside/snowslope/">Milton Keynes Xscape</a>. We figured it was time to explore more of the West/North West/Midlands and so based ourselves around there for the week.</p>

<p>We took the opportunity to stop off at Chatsworth and spent a very pleasant afternoon strolling around the <a href="http://www.chatsworth.org/whattodo/garden.htm">grounds</a> and the <a href="http://www.chatsworth.org/whattodo/house.htm">house</a>. (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157602248896148/">More photos</a>) . The “<a href="http://www.chatsworth.org/whattodo/garden_sothebys.htm">Beyond Limits</a>” exhibition was a really interesting addition to the beautiful gardens, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/1479240939/in/set-72157602248896148/">Damien Hirst’s Virgin Mary</a> was really impressive. As a Girl Guide I visited the extended grounds of Chatsworth many times, camping on the grounds, staying in stone barns, but this was the first time I’d visited the house and gardens. It was a really lovely afternoon, and the cake in the cafe was wonderful too.</p>

<p>Our next stop was a couple of nights in Liverpool, a city I’d only visited once before for a University open day, and which Richard hadn’t visited at all. As Liverpool is to be the City of Culture next year, we thought now might be an interesting to visit as it prepares itself. It is definitely a work in progress at the moment, and the number of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/1526332262/in/set-72157602335321600/">cranes on the skyline</a> is quite impressive. We felt obliged to visit the Beatles story exhibition, which entertained us for quite a few hours. We also visited the Tate which unfortunately for us was having a swap around to make room for the Turner Prize exhibitons. We were both surprised at how small a city it is, being really walkable and not requiring public transport to get around the major attractions. I found the architecture amazing, and it reminded me quite a bit of Hull, my home town. Both cities are ports, both were heavily bombed during the 2nd world war, both have some amazing maritime buildings. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157602335321600/">More photos</a>. </p>

<p>Then a fun few days in Wales staying at <a href="http://www.caegwynfarm.co.uk/">Cae Gwyn Farm</a> an organic bed and breakfast found via the <a href="http://www.organicholidays.co.uk/">Organic Holiday directory</a>. We attempted to do some mountain biking, but couldn’t find an open rental shop. As usual, wherever we go, things are closed. Maybe we should go “in season” sometime :-). Still we managed to get some walks in, one <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=/maps/2007/W20070927104358.kml">around</a> the <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6cqheq">visitor centre</a>, a <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=/maps/2007/W20070927120536.kml">longer one</a> around the <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/recreation.nsf/LUWebDocsByKey/WalesGwyneddNoForestCoedyBreninCoedyBreninVisitorCentre">forest</a> and one <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=/maps/2007/W20070927154716.kml">in Barmouth on the beach</a> at low tide. and a <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=/maps/2007/W20070926143344.kml">trip</a> on the <a href="http://www.snowdonrailway.co.uk/">Snowdon Mountain railway</a>.</p>

<p>A great trip, and a great opportunity to unwind.</p>
