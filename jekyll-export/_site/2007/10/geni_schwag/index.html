<p>I <a href="/2007/06/family_trees">blogged about Geni</a> a few months ago and had quite a few email conversations with the guys from <a href="http://www.geni.com/tree">Geni</a> off the back of that blog.</p>

<p>Since then Richard’s family have really taken to Geni, and have added a couple of generations to their tree. They’ve found it really usable and seem to have enjoyed adding photos etc. Still no GEDCOM import yet for me though 🙁</p>

<p>Today, a box of goodies arrived from Geni for me, thanks Geni!<br clear="all" />“</p>
