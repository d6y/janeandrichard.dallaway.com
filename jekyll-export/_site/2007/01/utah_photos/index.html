<p>Iâ€™ve spent the morning producing the photos for our recent <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157594543067056/">Utah</a> snowboarding trip. There are more snow based photos mainly because this year I bought a new small <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0601/06012604olympus_fe130_140.asp">Olympus FE-130</a> which is small, compact and cheap enough to not cause too much stress when boarding, there are a lot more on-slope photos than in <a href="/2006/03/colorado/">recent</a> <a href="/2005/04/canada/">years</a>.</p>
