<p>The council have <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1164145">put up a site</a> to calculate the time and cost of walking, cycling, driving or catching the bus around the city. <a href="http://www.journeyon.co.uk">JourneyOn.co.uk</a> seems to do a pretty reasonable job, even though it couldnâ€™t find a walking route for a walk I do fairly regularly. Looks like it could be handy.</p>
