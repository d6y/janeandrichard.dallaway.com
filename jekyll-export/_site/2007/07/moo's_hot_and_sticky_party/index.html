<p>On Thursday Richard and I headed off into London with a load of other Brighton geeks to <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/209918/">Moo’s Hot and Sticky Party</a>. Richard managed to attend <a href="/2007/05/the_moo_people_put">another moo party earlier in the year in San Francisco</a> and after hearing about that there was no way I was missing out on this one. This party was to launch another new product – <a href="http://www.moo.com/products/stickers.php">sticker books</a> and we got to take away samples (as well as stick them on each other, moo employees etc etc). </p>

<p>We met some new faces, put faces to names (especially <a href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/about-us/team/document-4-12.php">Will</a> and <a href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/about-us/team/document-5-12.php">Tom</a> who I’ve known of for years but weirdly never met) as well as catching up with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/854805195/in/set-72157600909891917/">someone</a> I haven’t seen in over 5 years.</p>

<p>A great party put on by a <a href="http://www.moo.com/">company</a> who obviously know how to celebrate! I even got 2 photos included in the <a href="http://www.moo.com/blog/2007/07/20/moo-stickers-party-you-all-rock/">moo blog post</a> about the evening. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157600909891917/">More photos.</a><br clear="all" /></p>
