<p>A month or so back I was given a <a href="http://www.3dconnexion.com/products/3a1d.php">SpaceNavigator</a> (let’s not go into the details, but let it be known that sometimes just turning up means people give you things). My initial plan was to eBay it, but it turns out these things are too cheap to eBay, so I decided to open it up and plug it in. </p>

<p>I’ve used with Google Earth (which is the only supported application I have), and I like it a lot. You don’t hold it in your hand (as my picture might suggest), but plonk it on the table and use twist, push, pull and turn the device to control Google Earth. It’s a much nicer experience than using the mouse and onscreen navigation.</p>

<p>Now if only they’d add support for Final Cut: it’d be great for scrubbing through video and marking in and out points.<br clear="all" /></p>
