<p>With Jane’s Nokia 6110 navigator, and the other GPS devices we have, we’re going to be accumulating KML files. We already have, in fact. We use them in Google Earth, but recently Google added the ability to show KML data in Google Maps. So here’s a couple of examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/Airports_of_the_NW.kmz">locations of airports in the north-western USA</a> (beta, do not use for navigation, all disclaimers apply)</li>
  <li><a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=http:%2F%2Fwww.janeandrichard.co.uk%2Fmaps%2Fwolf.kml&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=41.309339,-111.867034&amp;spn=0.01117,0.013733&amp;t=k&amp;z=16&amp;om=1">a day in Wolf Mountain</a></li>
</ul>
