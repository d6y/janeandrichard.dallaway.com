<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://andybudd.com/">Andy</a> for telling us about <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/whatson/fooddrink/waves/">Waves</a> in Hove. They are a Dosa Diner, and carry dosas as well as idli, pooris and other indian “street food”.</p>

<p>We headed out there this evening and gave them a try, and we’ll be back having had a most satisfying eat on dhai poori, masala dosa for me and a spring dosa for Richard. All washed down with a glass of red for Richard, and a couple of sweet lassis for me.<br clear="all" /></p>
