<p>We spent the weekend taking the excellent <a href="http://www.snowboardcoach.co.uk/firstpage.htm">SnowboardCoach.co.uk</a> 2 day <a href="http://www.snowboardcoach.co.uk/performance.htm">Performance Course</a> at <a href="http://www.xscape.co.uk/snow/milton-keynes/">Xscape in Milton Keynes</a>. We were a group of 8, and <a href="http://www.snowboardcoach.co.uk/ashnewnesprofile.htm">Ash</a> managed to keep an eye on all of us giving feedback and advice â€“ my main area to keep an eye on is not to use my upper body/shoulders to initiate turns. We did lots of drills, some designed to get us to understand the physics behind snowboarding, others to emphasise a point. An excellent course, which has really given me a desire to head off back to Milton Keynes soon and continue my practice.</p>
