<p>I did quite a bit of work on my <a href="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/tree/index.html">family tree</a> years ago and bought a copy of <a href="http://www.familytreemaker.com/FTM16.aspx">Family Tree Maker</a> at the time. Since then I’ve installed it on machine after machine until now, when I have a mac and don’t want to install parallels just to run a very old version of FTW. Instead I downloaded a copy of <a href="http://www.onlymac.de/html/stammbaum4en.html">MacFamilyTree</a> which is quite a pleasant application, and works well with the GED file exported from FTW, but seems to be short on a couple of useful features whilst still in demo mode, and until I know what those features are like I don’t particularly want to spend $50.</p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="http://twitter.com/aral/statuses/119930742">Aral twittered about Geni</a> and Richard quickly sent me the <a href="http://www.geni.com/">link</a>. It looks like quite a nice way to get a quick visualisation of your family tree, and is very usable, allowing you to invite other members of your family to contribute. Unfortunately for me there is no way to <a href="http://forum.geni.com/topic.php?id=14&amp;page">import GEDCOM files</a> yet and until then it won’t become a usable solution as I’m not about to retype 150 or so peoples data in. Sigh!</p>
