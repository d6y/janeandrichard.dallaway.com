<p>Whilst at <a href="http://www.alivehealth.co.uk/">the gym</a> this morning, one of the screens was showing BBC2 and more specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypto_the_Superdog">Krypto the Superdog</a>. The gym has a couple of screens, and this morning the other screen was showing MTV and the sound from this was being piped out. This led to me having a moment of realisation, as this was one of those cartoons where you donâ€™t actually need to hear the voices and soundtrack to know what is going on, meaning that you could use such a cartoon for language studies, as you could pick up the story without having to understand every word. Thanks to Mike who sits opposite me at work for finding the video clip :-).</p>
