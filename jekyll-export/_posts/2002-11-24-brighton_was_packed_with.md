Brighton was packed with police yesterday. Back at home, I was flipping through the TV channels trying to catch the local news to see if they had any information (nope) but I found &#8220;What the papers say&#8221; on BBC2. Their [newspaper photo of the year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/whatthepaperssay) nominations are interesting. I think I&#8217;ll vote for the &#8220;John Major and his lady friends&#8221; photo (at the time of writing the &#8220;Argentinian handbags&#8221; has the most votes, just ahead of &#8220;11 September&#8221;).
