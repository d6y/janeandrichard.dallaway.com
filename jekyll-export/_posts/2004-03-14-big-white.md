**March 2004**

We headed off for a weeks snowboarding to [Big White](http://www.bigwhite.com/) in Canada, and tagged a day in Vancouver on the front to take advantage of a good exchange rate to buy some [cheaper snowboarding gear](http://www.sportmart.ca/store/2index.asp?countryID=0). Managed to eat in a great restaurant, before heading off to Big White. We&#8217;d hired a Dodge Dorango so fitting 5 of us plus gear in wasn&#8217;t a problem &#8211; although picking up our groceries in Kelowna on the way through did mean that people were resting their feet on crates of beer.

Big White was a great resort with enough terrain to keep us (beginners) and Jeremy and Kirsty (experts) happy, our [accommodation](http://www.rentchalets.com/lodge/1071/index.php?action=search&workingAccommodationPage=2&workingMinPerson=9&workingMaxPerson=11) was excellent and although there aren&#8217;t a huge amount of restaurants there was enough to keep us occupied for a week.

From the snowboarding perspective, we had a couple of 2 hour semi-private lessons which were really good. Very high quality and certainly helped us to get the most out of our [second snowboarding holiday](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2003/01/les-arcs/).
