You can have a couple of minutes of fun over at [spatial-literacy.org](http://www.spatial-literacy.org) tracking the distribution of your family surname. Turns out that [&#8220;Dallaway&#8221;](http://www.dallaway.org/history.htm) isn&#8217;t terribly [diverse](http://www.spatial-literacy.org/UCLnames/Statistics.aspx?name=DALLAWAY&altyear=1881&year=1998&country=GB&type=name).
