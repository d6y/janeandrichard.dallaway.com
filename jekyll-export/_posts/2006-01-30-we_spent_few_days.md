We spent a few days in Les Allues, France over New Year with Jeremy and Kirsty and spent the time snowboarding in [Les 3 Vallees](http://www.les3vallees.com/uk/index.php). We made use of our lift tickets and spent some time in each of the other 2 valleys, but spent most of our time in Meribel and Meribel Mottaret. We were really fortunate and had 2 powder days &#8211; New Years Eve and New Years Day &#8211; what an amazing way to start a new year.

We spent New Years Eve (and in fact most other evenings) at La Tsaretta in the village.

A great break, and Meribel and the surrounding area is definitely a resort I could return to.
