I blogged over at [jane.dallaway.com](http://jane.dallaway.com) about my success at getting the [booklist](http://jane.dallaway.com/booklist.html) [running off del.icio.us tags](http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/2006/10/reading-list-now-running-off-delicious.html). This morning I had a bit of a brainwave, and decided to do the same with [snowboard resorts](http://jane.dallaway.com/snow.html). So, with the addition of a couple of new [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) tags of &#8220;riddenat&#8221; and &#8220;torideat&#8221; I&#8217;ve got a list of resorts (and I&#8217;ve added country tags too) by country that I&#8217;ve been to, and a simple list of ones to visit in our next trip (to [Utah](http://www.skiutah.com/)).
