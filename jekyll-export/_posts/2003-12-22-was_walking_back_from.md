I was walking back from a meeting the other day, possibly along [St Nicholas Road](http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?X=530750&Y=104500&scale=5000&coordsys=gb) in Brighton, and
  
a fair number of the houses had gone to the trouble to turn their front windows
  
into a Christmas scene. No idea if it&#8217;s organized or spontaneous, a one-off or annual, but it
  
a fun to stumble upon these things. Hmm&#8230; St Nicholas Rd/[Saint Nicholas](http://www.stnicholascenter.org/Brix?pageID=23)&#8230; it all makes sense, assuming
  
I&#8217;ve got the street name right.
