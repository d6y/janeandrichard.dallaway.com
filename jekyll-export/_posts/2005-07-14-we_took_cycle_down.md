We took a cycle down to the [Sand Sculpture Festival](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2005/07/there_are_sand_sculptures) this evening. Nothing much visible from outside due to the high fences they&#8217;ve put around, but we did manage to get a glance from the main road. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll head off during the summer sometime and pay the admission costs (&#xA3;6 for adults, and &#xA3;4 for children) to go and have a proper look around.
