Over the weekend I ordered some more memory cards for my camera. I originally wanted a [SmartDisk Flash Trax](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0303/03030217smartdiskflashtrax.asp) but I couldn&#8217;t really afford the &#xA3;399 price tag. So, I opted for some more memory cards instead. I&#8217;m very impressed with the service I got. I ordered 3 cards on Sunday afternoon, an 1GB IBM Microdrive from [JetMedia](http://www.jetmedia.co.uk/) and 2 256 MB SanDisk cards from [Widget](http://www.widget.co.uk/asp/default.asp). Both of my orders arrived today so I&#8217;m pretty impressed.
