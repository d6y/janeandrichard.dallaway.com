We went to the cafe scientifique at its new venue on Tuesday after the [terraces made it homeless](http://www.theargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1045932.0.academics_dont_drink_enough_says_bar_boss.php). An interesting talk &#8220;Power lines to mobile phones: hot air or hazard?&#8221; by Alan Preece of the [Bristol Oncology Centre&#8221;](http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/Oncology/BOC/). Beer was drunk, questions were asked, issues were raised. There seems to be proof that mobile phones heat up areas of the brain, but in research that speeded up responses, rather than causing any interference. Not sure I want my brain heated up, so I&#8217;m in the market for a hands free kit for my phone. The new venue worked out ok, a bit cosier than the terraces, and not as &#8220;cool&#8221; but nice and a good atmosphere.
