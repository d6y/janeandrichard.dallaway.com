During our time away in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo, we decided to use iPhone apps whenever possible to get by. These are the apps we found useful:

  * [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) &#8211; brilliant for keeping light reading to hand.  The pro version is needed unless you can live with just a small number of pages.
  * [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) &#8211; for travel documents, and entertainment.
  * Built-in Maps app &#8211; generally filling the cache when we had WiFI and then using the GPS on the 3GS to find our way around.
  * The built-in Screen shot (hold iPhone menu button and power button) &#8211; great for capturing images of maps  with a route on when you have WiFi but think you might lose the map or directions out of the cache later.
  * [Todo](http://www.appigo.com/todo/) &#8211; for getting junk out of our heads so we could forget about stuff and enjoy ourselves.
  * [FelaurPDF](http://felaur.com/pdf/) &#8211; transport maps which were too large to view on the in-built PDF viewer.
  * [Power Plug](http://www.concentricsky.com/products/iphone/powerplug/) &#8211; visual reference for the power sockets around the world.
  * [Metro](http://metro.nanika.net/index.php?p=Z) &#8211; for finding our way around Hong Kong and Tokyo.
  * [Weather Pro](http://www.weatherpro.eu) &#8211; use this everyday to plan for the weather.
  * [Currency](http://www.currencyapp.com/support/) &#8211; handy for converting back to GBP.
  * The built-in camera app &#8211; obviously, but useful to snap route information to look at later.
  * Sydney Travel Guide  from [Fidesereef](http://www.fidesreef.com/)
  * HongKong Travel Guide also from Fidesreef.
  * Tokyo Travel Guide from Fidesreef, again.
  * [Tokyo Zuti](http://www.zuti.co.uk/) for getting around the train system.
  * [Tokyo Cool City Guide](http://nozomii.com/tokyocool/contact.cfm-menu=4.htm)
  * [Transit Sydney](http://www.funkworks.com.au/products/transit-sydney/)
  * [Sydney Street Map](http://mobile-streetmaps.com/) &#8211; offline map with GPS support.
  * [Hong Kong 720](http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/interactive/mobile-guides.html) (useful before we went)
  * NHS [DrinksTracker](http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/iphonedrinks.aspx) &#8211; for keeping score.

We also had TripIt, Dopplr and TripAdvisor apps, but I don&#8217;t think we used them.

We picked up one paper guide: at Sydney airport we did a Loney Planet &#8220;print and bind&#8221; of a chapter of Tokyo from one of their travel guides.  This was so that I had something to use on the flight to figure out what we were going to do in Tokyo in a limited amount of time.  As a bonus, the guide was bound in an anonymous brown card, making us look less touristy if we needed to refer to it.<figure id="attachment_1584" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
