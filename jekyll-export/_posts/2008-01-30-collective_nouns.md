I was having a conversation with [Alex](http://beautyandruin.com/monkeys/) earlier, and we started talking about collective nouns. My personal favourite is still an &#8220;ostentation of peacocks&#8221;. We found various online resources ([Animal Groups](http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Pointless/AnimalGroups.html), and of course [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_collective_nouns_by_subject_A-H) has something to offer) to ponder and discussed how much some of these words really had anything to do with the object being collected &#8211; an &#8220;aurora of polar bears&#8221; for instance.

Wikipedia also offers collective nouns for job types as well, offering among others a sulk of developers. We&#8217;d already been thinking of terms for developers, designers, project managers and the other disciplines we have here at [work](http://www.madgex.com) and came up with a &#8220;creation of designers&#8221;, &#8220;list of project managers&#8221; and the fairly obvious &#8220;Victory of Madgexians&#8221; (paying homage to the [Madgex Arms](http://ultimatepubguide.com/pubs/info.phtml?pub_id=151) of course).

Any suggestions to offer? If so, leave a comment and I&#8217;ll try and collate them.
