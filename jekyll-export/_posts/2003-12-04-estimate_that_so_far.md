I&#8217;d estimate that so far [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) has saved me about &#163;100 in call costs this month. That&#8217;s not quite true: I probably wouldn&#8217;t have made the calls, if I had to continue to pay BTs rates for calls to Australia. Skype just works and right now is free, but (there&#8217;s always a downside) it&#8217;s Windows only.
