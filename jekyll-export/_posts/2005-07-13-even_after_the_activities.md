Even after the [activities of Thursday](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2005/07/don_really_have_anything), we decided to go ahead with our plans to spend some of the weekend in London catching up with friends. We stayed overnight at [Club Quarters Gracechurch street](http://www.lastminute.com/lmn/pso/catalog/Product.jhtml?POSITION=1&PRODID=390318171&CATID=4) which was really pleasant &#8211; and somewhere I can see us returning to. We caught up with [Neela, Ste](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/neelastewedding/190_9026/), [Ash and Mit&#252;l](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/neelastewedding/190_9042_r1/) over in Greenford and got to visit both VB & Sons Indian supermarket (discovering all manner of [new vegetables](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=casava)) and try some really wonderful Indian and Pakistani food at [Five Hot Chillies](http://eatdrink.timeout.com/search2/view/4538.html) in Sudbury ([nominated](http://www.redhotcurry.com/eating_out/general/london_restaurant_awards2005_shortlist.htm) for a [2005 restaurant award](http://www2.angliatv.com/restaurantawards/nominees_indian.htm)).

On Sunday, after a lovely stroll over to Tower Bridge, we headed off on the [DLR](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/dlr/) and caught up with Suz and Greg over at their new place overlooking the [Royal Victoria Dock](http://www.londontown.com/LondonInformation/Attraction/Royal_Victoria_Dock/4bdf/) in [Docklands](http://www.mydocklands.co.uk/) &#8211; a really spacious airy flat with a really relaxing view out over the water.
