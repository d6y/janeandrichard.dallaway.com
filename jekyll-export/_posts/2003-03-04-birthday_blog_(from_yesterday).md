Yesterday was my birthday (huzzah) and I have many exciting things to blog about, but for now here&#8217;s the summary.

I have a stack of Raymond Carver short stories to read,
  
I now have a nice looking chunk of [moon](http://www.dgm2.com/m/iwanto/b.asp?A=14589&I=2385&c=http://www.iwantoneofthose.com/life.asp?st=00236), Jane found [Ripping Yarns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005LDFS/qid=1046760518/richarddallaway) on DVD and also found me a very cool retro-looking [mini DV recorder](http://www.aiptek.com/products/digital/dv.htm) (need to find another photo, because it doesn&#8217;t look like that). 

Update: [This](http://www.dgm2.com/m/firebox/b_fb.asp?A=1458&I=41&c=product.php?pid=402) is what mine looks like

If that wasn&#8217;t &#8220;woohoo!&#8221; enough, we went out to see Brighton Bears win [107-92](http://www.brightonbears.com/fixtures/fixture_details.asp?fix_id=43) against the Newcastle Eagles. I won&#8217;t post up any of the video we took during the game because I need to spend more time learning how to use the DV recorder&#8230;

This isn&#8217;t going to sound right, but one of the interval &#8220;fun things&#8221; is the Duck Chuck: people buy ducks and throw them onto the court, and if they land in just the right places prizes are won. Just imagine sitting down, not quite knowing what&#8217;s going on, and then 200 small plastic ducks flying through the air onto the court. It leaves a lasting impression, trust me.

We ate at
  
Picasso as part of our quest for find the very best pizza in Brighton. What we found was Pizza for &#163;3 and a lot of students. It was fine default pizza, better than many other places with the obvious benefit of being amazingly cheap. We&#8217;ll be back there, but our quest for the very best in pizza continues&#8230;
