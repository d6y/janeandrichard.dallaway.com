Over Christmas I bought a 500ml bottle of [Molton Brown Shower gel](http://www.moltonbrown.co.uk/shop/moreinfo.cfm?itemid=46&price=&#xA3;11.00). Last week I started using it and dropped it, smashing the pump dispenser lid. Over the weekend I went into the [Molton Brown](http://www.moltonbrown.co.uk/index.cfm?currency=GBP) shop and asked if I could buy a [replacement dispenser](http://www.moltonbrown.co.uk/shop/moreinfo.cfm?itemid=221&price=&#xA3;1.50). Unfortunately they don&#8217;t stock them for the big bottles, but the lady found a 500ml bottle from their stock room, took out the dispenser, washed it and gave it to me, all for no cost. Good customer service still lives.
