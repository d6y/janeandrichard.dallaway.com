It&#8217;ll probably never happen, which is a shame: &#8220;The holiday resort, named [Pleasure Island](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/southern_counties/3261343.stm), would be based two thirds of a mile off the coast of Brighton, between the city&#8217;s two piers&#8221;. 

Does anyone else mentally picture a man in a white suit greeting guests: &#8220;[Welcome to Pleasure Island](http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/ShowMainServlet/showid-679/Fantasy_Island/)&#8220;

&#8220;An area of the development would also be set aside for low cost housing and flats&#8221; which I can only assume is designed to be the equivalent of a [factory town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_town) for anyone working on this luxury resort.
