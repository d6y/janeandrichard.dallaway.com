Seeing as how we&#8217;re doing more cycling, we thought we&#8217;d buy some proper cycling clothes. Someone had recommended [Ground Effect](http://www.groundeffect.co.nz) to us despite them being in New Zealand. We had a look at their stuff, and it certainly looked a bit cooler than some of the other manufacturers, and a whole lot better than what we could find in the shops around Brighton. We made our order on Monday evening, and today the first set of clothing arrived &#8211; a pair of [Tom Thumbs](http://www.groundeffect.co.nz/tom-thumbs.htm) (cycling shorts), some [Witches Britches](http://www.groundeffect.co.nz/witches.htm), a [Presto](http://www.groundeffect.co.nz/presto.htm) top and a pair of [RanchSliders](http://www.groundeffect.co.nz/ranchsliders.htm) for Richard. We&#8217;re pretty impressed with the delivery time &#8211; half way around the world in 4.5 days. Hopefully, it&#8217;ll stop raining before tomorrow and we can try some of our new purchases out.
