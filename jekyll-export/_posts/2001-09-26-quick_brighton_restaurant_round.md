A quick Brighton restaurant round-up. So far, the places&#8217;s we&#8217;ve tried include: 

[Jim Thompson&#8217;s](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/chinese/jims.html) a mix of all things oriental. It&#8217;s right by the [Palace Pier](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/latesummer2001/?style=fullsize.xsl&select=img_0585_640), over looking the sea, so
  
I thought &#8220;oh-oh, it&#8217;s going to be great location, terrible food&#8221;. But I was wrong
  
the food is good, but the cocktails are terrible. Watery is the only way I can describe them. Could it
  
be because we were at the &#8220;2 cocktails for the price of 1&#8221; night? If so they should rename it to &#8220;2 crap cocktails for the price of 1&#8221; night. One of the local radio stations ran one of their ads which claimed &#8220;the best cocktails in Brighton&#8221;. God help us.

In contrast is the small Greek/Spanish/Italian mix of **Ipanema**. We were tempted
  
with the sign out side selling us fresh Snapper and Monk Fish. What were we expecting? Something
  
along the lines of the fresh fish we&#8217;d eaten in [New Zealand](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/nz2001.html). Naturally we were disappointed.
  
It&#8217;s not a bad place; but we were underwhelmed.

[Le Gastronome](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/french/gastronome.html) is an expensive but lovely French restaurant. Yum. It was full when we
  
arrived, so we left despondent. Half-way down the road the owner comes running
  
after us to tell us they&#8217;ve just had a cancellation and there was now space for us. And
  
to top it all off, the food was good too.

Last one: the [Viceroy of India](http://www.bton63.freeserve.co.uk/viceroy.htm). It was empty. We went in, and drank beer and ate
  
curry. Tasty curry.
