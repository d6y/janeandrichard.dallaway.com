Whilst we were in Ireland, Brighton was host to Normstock II, the second [Big Beach Boutique](http://www.bigbeachboutique.com/) event. Last year there were around 60,000 people on the beach for Fat Boy Slim&#8217;s free event, this year there were 250,000. There are photos and a few more details available [here](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/big_beach_boutique/photo_special/).
