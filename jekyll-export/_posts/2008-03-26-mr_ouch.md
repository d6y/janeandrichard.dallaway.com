I took this photo in the grounds of the [Morning Star Lodge](http://www.silvermt.com/Lodging/default.aspx?page=Lodging) near the [Silver Mountain](http://www.silvermt.com/) Gondola station in Kellogg, Idaho with the sole intention of posting it to the [Stick Figures in Peril group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/stickfiguresinperil/). This I duly did and someone added a tag of Mr Ouch. I was curious about this and so looked at [all photos tagged with Mr Ouch](http://icanhaz.com/mrouch) and discovered that they are all the same peril picture but with different text, instructions and warnings &#8211; a sub domain of stick figures in peril.

I will now be on the lookout for other Mr Ouch warning signs to add to the collection.<br clear="all" />
