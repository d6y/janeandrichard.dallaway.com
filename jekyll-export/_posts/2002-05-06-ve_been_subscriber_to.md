I&#8217;ve been a subscriber to Wanderlust &#8211; a travel magazine designed for more independent travellers &#8211; for about 4 years now, and today I&#8217;ve been catching up on the last few editions. The first I read was the 50th edition, and had an article of 50 things to do in New Zealand &#8211; by my calculation we achieved 5.5 of them [when we were there](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/nz2001.html). Must try harder next time :-). They also had a small article saying that they&#8217;d relaunched their [website](http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/). I&#8217;ve just been for a quick look, and it is much better than it was, being able to look at the [events section](http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/magazine/events.html) is really handy. Well done Wanderlust.
