It&#8217;s [Brighton Comedy Festival](http://www.brightoncomedyfestival.co.uk/2005/index.asp) time again, and today we&#8217;ve been to the only event we&#8217;ve planned for this year &#8211; [Paul Merton&#8217;s Impro Chums](http://www.brighton-dome.org.uk/events/eventdetails.asp?id=1764). We went to this event last year as well, and it was still excellent, with some marvellous suggestions from the audience. Quite sad to see [Jim Sweeney](http://jimsweeney.co.uk/) in a wheelchair now, last year he was still using walking sticks to get about.
