We spent this afternoon at the [London Metro Ski and Snowboard Show 2006](http://www.metroskishow.co.uk/2006/) at Kensington Olympia. We didn&#8217;t have much to do today, so thought we&#8217;d go and take a look at the show. Overall, I&#8217;m glad we did. At &#xA3;14 per adult, it wasn&#8217;t the cheapest day out, especially when you add the &#xA3;12 parking, but we got some great ideas for trips for our next few years. We found out more about snowboarding in [Japan](http://www.japantravel.co.uk/index_en.htm) (apparently February is the best time to go as it is the time of the snow festival, and there are lots of ice sculptures and ice caves created), and also [another](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/10/we_joined_ski_safari) company ([dreamski](http://www.dreamskiadventures.com)) offering guided trips to [Chile](http://www.dreamskiadventures.com/whychile.html) and another company offering [ski weekends](http://www.skiweekends.com/).

The [Skill Slope](http://www.metroskishow.co.uk/2006/features/skillsslope.html) did great business today, lots of skiers &#8211; no snowboarding today though üôÅ

We also found the [SportsDo](http://sportsdo.net/) gps system, making use of a java enabled or windows mobile phone using a bluetooth connection to an [external gps unit](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Globalsat-BT338-x-trac-bluetooth-receiver/dp/B00092759S/richarddallaway) to record journeys of all kind &#8211; drive, walk, run, ski, cycle etc. Sounds like a great idea, now to see if it works!
