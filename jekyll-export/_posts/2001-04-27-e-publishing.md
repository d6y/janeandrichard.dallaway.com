I&#8217;ve just finished reading an e-book, one of only two that money has been spent on. I&#8217;ve read quite a few classics from [memoware.com](http://www.memoware.com) (available free of charge). The first book I read which was only digitally released was &#8220;Jagged Greenstone&#8221; by Loren Teague (get it [here](http://www.pdabookstore.com/cgi-bin/bookstore.cgi?Any=jagged)). Whilst the story, from what I recall, was possibly a little weak, I found the experience of reading it on the [visor](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/visor.xml) a pleasant one.

&#8221;

The book I&#8217;ve just finished,
  
&#8220;Presumption of Guilt&#8221; by Jay Abramson, was not such a good experience. I like the whole e-publishing idea. I think it&#8217;s a good way to get published, and a good way to test the waters with a story. However, I do not think that it is an excuse for poor spelling, poor grammar and missing words. &#8220;Presumption of Guilt&#8221; is littered with them. This distracted from the whole experience for me, and I feel that the $6 that my friend paid to buy this book for me could have been better spent.

I am not going to let this unpleasant experience stop me from reading more books in this way. But, I might be more careful in how I choose them. ([Pdabookstore.com](http://www.pdabookstore.com) allow you, in most cases, to download a free excerpt, normally a chapter or so). I don&#8217;t think digital publishing should do away with the quality elelment. If money is being paid for an e-book, then I want it to be of the same quality as if I was paying for printed media. The odd mistake is understandable, even bestsellers have those, but the amount of errors in this indicated that it had never even been proof-read.

Ironically, &#8220;Presumption of Guilt&#8221; is actually a pretty good story, lots of twists and turns, possibly a little bit slow in places but overall pretty good. It&#8217;s a shame that I don&#8217;t feel that I could ever recommend it because of the grammar and spelling errors.

My grammar may not be perfect, but I&#8217;m not charging you $6 to read this ðŸ™‚
