We visited Steff, Simes, Daisy and Noah over the weekend which was smashing. I&#8217;d just like to thank Steff for introducing me to the concept of serving [Ben & Jerry&#8217;s](http://www.benjerry.com/) in slices: it makes perfect sense. 

Oh, the photo? It just goes to show that it&#8217;s hard to make a [Red Panda](http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/6.shtml) balance on your head for very long.
