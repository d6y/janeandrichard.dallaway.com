Another snowboarding blog, from [Wired News](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,62947,00.html?tw=rss.TOP) via [Luke](http://www.snowgo.com/archives/2004/04/06/paper_snowboards.php). 13 colleges in the US took part in the [Department of Energy](http://www.energy.gov/engine/content.do)&#8216;s [Energy Challenge](http://www.ipst.gatech.edu/energy_challenge/frameset.html) competition last weekend which, this year, was to design, construct and race a snowboard constructed from paper based materials down the slopes at the [Winter Park resort](http://www.worldsnowboardguide.com/resorts/resort_home.cfm?selResort=456) in Colorado.
