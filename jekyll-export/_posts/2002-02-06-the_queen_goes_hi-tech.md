Okay, not exactly, but I noticed from a [story](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1803000/1803715.stm) on the BBC that the Queen has released a [message](http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page920.asp) to celebrate the 50th anniversary of her Accession to the throne &#8211; on the Royal Family&#8217;s website. Do you think she&#8217;s going to start blogging?
