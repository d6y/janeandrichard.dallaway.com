We bought a new [recipe book](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/books/reviews/jane/lowfatlowsugar.xml) a couple of weeks ago, and it&#8217;s full or really tasty recipes, and they&#8217;re healthy too. The recipes are designed to be low fat and low sugar, and best of all tasty. We&#8217;ve tried 5 or 6 recipes so far, and only one of them was slightly dissapointing, the others have been great.
