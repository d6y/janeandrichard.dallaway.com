So, whilst we were on our holidays another bit of the West Pier [collapsed](http://www.thisisbrighton.co.uk/brighton__hove/archive/2003/01/20/NEWS65ZM.html). Looks like we lost our opportunity to do a tour of it then! Bah!

Update: Just found [these photos](http://www.realbrighton.com/story.asp?story_id=149). It looks like the front (land part) of the pier has squashed even more.
