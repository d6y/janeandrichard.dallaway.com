I listened to Cherie Blair&#8217;s [statement](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2563751.stm) on [Radio 5](http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live) on the way back from Chesterfield last night about the whole [Peter Foster and flat buying](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2546835.stm) thing. It left me with a couple of questions &#8211; why are there [2 flats in Bristol](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2547617.stm) &#8211; what is the other one for?, and why isn&#8217;t student accommodation good enough for their son? With a government policy that seems to be making it [increasingly hard for students to survive without debt](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/education/2002/higher_education_review/), why should he get such a helping hand? I also hadn&#8217;t realised that he had [government officials helping him with his homework](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1691165.stm) this time last year! Nice!
