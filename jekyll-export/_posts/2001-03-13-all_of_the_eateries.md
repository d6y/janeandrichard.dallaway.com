All of the eateries around the office, in Hatton Gardens, are getting worse.

Our favourite cafe was &#8220;refurbished&#8221; over Christmas and re-opened with new decor and new owners. The food hasn&#8217;t been as good since then, so we only go there once a week, rather than every day.

We went to another one today, Aud&#8217;s, on Greville Street. The food was okay, but the service was pretty poor. We&#8217;d only just finished eating before we were asked to leave as other people were waiting. We weren&#8217;t actually intending to sit there all day, but this was just rude (the manner it was said wasn&#8217;t pleasant either)

So, we&#8217;re on the hunt for a good, reliable cafe, which serves breakfasts and jacket potatoes, and maybe even omelette baps. Any suggestions anyone?
