Neil Gaiman (co-author with Terry Prachett of &#8220;[Good Omens](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552137030/richarddallaway)&#8221; &#8211; a book I thoroughly enjoyed both times I read it) has a [blog](http://www.americangods.com/journal/journal.asp). It is well written, funny and well worth reading and covers his experiences during his promotional tour and book signings for his new book &#8220;[American Gods](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747274231/richarddallaway)&#8220;. He is currently in the US, but has [book signing dates](http://www.americangods.com/otr/otr.asp) booked in the UK and in Canada in July.
