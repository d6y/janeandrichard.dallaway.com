We went to see [Aladdin](http://www.theambassadors.com/theatreroyal/sp_p349.html) at the [Theatre Royal](http://www.theambassadors.com/theatreroyal/) the other night after I&#8217;d [won tickets](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/12/winning_streak). It had been many years since my last panto experience, and many more years since Richard&#8217;s last visit, but it was a fun night. 7 year old girls really, really love [Chico](http://www.chicomusic.com/) &#8211; the one behind us was screaming &#8220;[What time is it?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Chico_Time)&#8221; at the top of her (very shrill) voice. We thought [Toyah](http://www.toyahwillcox.com/) was great, although I hadn&#8217;t realised quite how short she is. I was surprised at how long the panto lasted, we started off at around 6pm, and didn&#8217;t get out until 8.45pm &#8211; that seems to be a long time for small children to sit still for, but the majority of them were really well behaved and seemed to be loving it.
