I had an interview last week for which I had to do a pyschometric test. Yesterday I got to see the results of it. And they&#8217;re pretty accurate &#8211; which is scary. Apparently my descriptive words are:
  
Dependable, persistent, patient, kind, thorough, loyal, supportive, sincere, logical, systematic, steady, deliberate, communicative, friendly, persuasive, asks &#8216;why&#8217;, &#8216;who&#8217; and &#8216;how&#8217;.
