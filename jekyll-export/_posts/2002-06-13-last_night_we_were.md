Last night we were at a photo exhibition at the
   
[Gardner Arts Centre](http://www.artsoutheast.co.uk/member_home.cfm?name=gardner) called
   
[It&#8217;s Wrong to Wish on Space Hardware](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/USIS/now/event.cfm?id=2556). The trigger to go was the combination of having a copy of [Orbit: NASA Astronauts Photograph the Earth](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0792237145/richarddallaway) and also loving the [Billy Bragg](http://www.billybragg.co.uk/) song that the title is taken from ([New England](http://www.billybragg.co.uk/releases/albums/life_riot_spy/life4.html)). 

It was a free exhibition, and it was of a size that occupied us for about 15 minutes.
  
There was a mix of stuff: official NASA prints (my personal favourites), photos of the Russian space programme (best: a cosmonaut ready to go, but sitting on a nasty 70s sofa in what looked like someone&#8217;s living room), plus fake space shots: pictures of pancakes that resembled the moon, and windscreen bug splat that looked like the night sky.
