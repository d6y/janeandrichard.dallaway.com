We stayed in a couple of hotels over the weekend, the first was the [Hermitage Hotel in Bournemouth](http://www.hermitage-hotel.co.uk/) (where some friends held their wedding reception on Saturday evening). The Hermitage was quite a nice hotel, although it appeared that we were staying on a floor that was in the process of being refurbished (the room was nicely furnished, but there was no real floor other than hardboard in the corridors). The second was the [Passford House Hotel near Lymington](http://www.passfordhousehotel.co.uk/) (New Forest area). This was another hotel we found on the [Johansens website](http://www.johansens.com) (see our blog about [Aberystwyth](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/03/we_spent_the_weekend)) and again it was a wonderful experience. The service was excellent, and the food was of a high quality too.
