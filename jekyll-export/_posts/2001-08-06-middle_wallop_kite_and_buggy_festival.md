We headed off to [Middle Wallop airfield](http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?gride=&gridn=&width=700&height=400&client=europe&db=hcgaz&scale=50000&coordsys=gb&overviewmap=ap&X=430000&Y=137500&multimap.x=355&multimap.y=144) on Saturday afternoon, and spent a great hour or so playing with our delta (before the rain set in) and watching lots and lots of buggiers and mountain boarders enjoying the vast space available at this festival. This is the third kite festival we&#8217;ve been to and this was undoubtedly the best. It wasn&#8217;t the most informative (the Dunstable one probably was), however, there was a huge amount of space available to play in and just watching such a large number of buggys and boards was great.

I also spotted some team fliers practicing their routine in a manner I hadn&#8217;t seen before. They all had small sticks with cut-out kites on and were using those to run through their routine. I thought that this was a really good idea and was quite fun to watch.

We plan to return next year and spend a bit longer there. We may even have our own buggy by then!
