So, it looks like the people at [FriendsReunited](http://www.friendsreunited.co.uk) have come up with another idea. They&#8217;ve launched [GenesConnected](http://www.genesconnected.co.uk), a genealogical record site. So, you enter your family tree information and share it with other users. You can add your ancestors, and then search through other people&#8217;s trees to look for matches. If you find a likely looking match, you can email the contact and share your information. It has the same charging fee as FriendsReunited, so it&#8217;s a fiver per year. And from what I remember about genealogists, this won&#8217;t be a hard sell&#8230;
