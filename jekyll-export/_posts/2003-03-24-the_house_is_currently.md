The house is currently under siege. Seems there was a cat trapped in the bin cupboard (trash or refuse area) outside the house. And now it&#8217;s out and it&#8217;s pretty angry, or maybe distressed. No-one really wants to get too close to it to find out for sure. 

What are you supposed to do in these situations? The [RSPCA web site](http://www.rspca.org.uk) isn&#8217;t terribly helpful, so I gave them a call and they more-or-less said &#8220;forget it, but call us if you think it&#8217;s really really hurt&#8221;. So, my plan is to forget about it.
