I&#8217;ve been a fan of Terry Gilliam [films](http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/)
   
for a while,
  
although he&#8217;s perhaps more famous for the not
  
making films, or almost making films, or maybe for film
  
studious worrying about the films he makes with huge
  
piles of their money. While trying
  
to track down the [DVD version of Brazil](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/dvd/0783225903/contents/ref=pm_dp_ln_d_6/103-3177357-3099000), I spotted
  
the following on the [Terry Gilliam Fanzine](http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/):
  
&#8220;Lost in La Mancha gains BAFTA nomination&#8221;. Turns out
  
that [Lost in La Mancha](http://www.smart.co.uk/lostinlamancha/)
  
is the documentary of the making of his film, [The Man Who Killed Don Quixote](http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/donqfact.htm) that failed to be
  
made (did that make any sense?). Lost in La Mancha was apparently released
  
in August 2002, and should be on DVD by the end of the month ([view the trailer](http://www.ifctv.com/ifc/films/1,6387,CAT0-43-CAT1-2987-SHID-18344-VID-2625-CLR-red-BCLR-CC0000-,00.html)).
