We were listening to [Radio 5](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio5) last night when
  
we heard that the [Queen Mother had died](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/obituaries/queen_mother/default.stm). &#8220;And of course, due to the death of the Queen Mother, football matches with be&#8230;&#8221; was how we learned the news. So we went off and caught up with the news on [BBC News 24](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/audiovideo/programmes/bbc_news_24/default.stm).

Reece, who visited us today, told us that he&#8217;d
  
heard that the Queen Mother died because
  
she was eaten by a donkey. Kids, eh?
