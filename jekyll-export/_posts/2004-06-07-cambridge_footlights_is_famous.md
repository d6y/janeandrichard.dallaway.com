Cambridge Footlights is famous for [churning out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footlights) the famous. Except the year when we went. For some reason the following haven&#8217;t (yet) become Big Names:
  
[James Bachman](http://www.infinitemonkeys.co.uk/bachman/), [Katie Breathwick](http://www.lbc.co.uk/listingsentry.asp?id=99777), [Liz Hurran](http://www.en.utexas.edu/programs/shakespeare/aftls/castarchives/2003cast/elizabethhurran.html), [Daniel](http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/person.jsp?id=36182) [Mazer](http://www.pfd.co.uk/scripts/get.py/filmandtv/?ftwriters%20MAZERD), and [Robert Webb](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1292032). 

But hey, Big Name-ness isn&#8217;t everything, and we had a great time. Shame the show appears to be lost. Not even google can find me the lyrics to &#8220;Whales should live in Wales (There&#8217;s no whaling ships in Aberystwyth)&#8221; and other could-have-been hits from the show.
