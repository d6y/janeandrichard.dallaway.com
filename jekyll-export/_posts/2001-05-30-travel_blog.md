I&#8217;ve noticed that in the [blogger.com](http://www.blogger.com) Blogs of Note section recently there have been a couple of travel blogs. These are people who are using blogger to update their web sites during their travels. This is a great idea, and blogger provides a really good interface for this.

Some travel blogs I&#8217;ve looked at:

  * [The Strange California Journey](http://calijourney.blogspot.com/)
  * [Greg&#8217;s Appalachian Hike](http://www.tonyuniverse.com/gregshike/)
  * [Tina&#8217;s Travel&#8217;s through New Zealand, Australia, China and Southeast Asia](http://volatile.org/travel/)
