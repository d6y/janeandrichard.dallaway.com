[Medieval](http://www.google.com/search?q=define:medieval) history&#8230; dull dull dull. Except when Terry Jones does it. I only caught the last two episodes of [Medieval Lives](http://www.bbcfactual.co.uk/terry_jones_medieval_livesl.htm), but it was just smashing. Much was learned: Good King Richard I (actually bad); Bad King Richard II (actually good); Hunchback King Richard III (complete fabrication). Or that medieval society was very litigious, spending much time in court rather than, as I probably thought, eating mud or something. 

Reading [an interview](http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/474/474005p1.html) it looks the whole series would be pretty good.
  
There&#8217;s also [a book of the series](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0563487933/richarddallaway), but I don&#8217;t know what that&#8217;s like.
