Two thumbs up to [Robert Harding Computers](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=robert+harding+computers&near=Brighton,+UK&radius=0.0&latlng=50820723,-139901,2361557508240407141). My MacBook battery was going all wrong and had started to swell, and I was getting nowhere with AppleCare. Robert Harding gave me the clues and phone numbers which has resulted in a new battery arriving 24 hours later. They&#8217;re goooooood.
