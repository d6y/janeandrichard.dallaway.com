What&#8217;s the difference between [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia) and [h2g2](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/)? Reading up on [the thinking](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A550955) behind the creation of h2g2 makes it sounds
  
rather more exciting than [those behind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia) Wikipedia (even though someone has provided a [mobile interface for Wikipedia](http://maxpedia.org/web/maxpedia.html) now). 

Of course you can lookup the [Wikipedia entry for h2g2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2g2), and [visa versa](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A918434). But only h2g2 has [an entry comparing both](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2910007).
