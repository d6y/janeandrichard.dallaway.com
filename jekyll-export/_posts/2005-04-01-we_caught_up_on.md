We caught up on a bit of [Tivo](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml)&#8216;d tv last night, and watched [A place in the Sun](http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/A/a_place_in_the_sun/) which was about a lady contemplating the move to [Auckland](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/nz/auckland.html), New Zealand. This was the move that we considered in 2001 and rejected on the grounds that we would be cutting ourselves off from friends and family as a lot of people seemed to be having children at this time and that was really going to prevent most people from visiting us. Also all of our holiday allowance would end up being spent travelling back to the UK to see family and friends and this would stop us making the most of our opportunities in a new country. Interestingly, the lady on the programme also ended up staying in the UK for family reasons.

It got me thinking about our choice, instead of moving to Auckland we [moved to Brighton](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/ealing2brighton/) (lots more outdoor living opportunities than Ealing had. although admittedly not the climate that Auckland has) and this has worked out really well for us. I&#8217;d still like to go on a long visit to New Zealand to experience it properly though.
