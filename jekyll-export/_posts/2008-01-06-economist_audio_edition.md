For six months or so I&#8217;ve been grabbing the [audio edition of The Economist](http://talkingissues.economist.com/). It&#8217;s superb in terms of quality and mad in terms of size. Each week they churn out about 6 hours of word-for-word reading of the week&#8217;s articles (the christmas edition was over 9 hours). That&#8217;s a lot of stuff, and they manage to get this out by the end of Friday every week.

It&#8217;s not a substitute for the newspaper for a couple of reasons. First, the download is a ZIP of MP3 files (which is fine), but you have to guess if you want to listen to a story based on a rather short file name. I find I can make better decisions on what I want to read by flipping through the print edition. The second reason you don&#8217;t want to rely on the audio is that the print and web editions include graphics, which are often excellent. Check out the [free daily charts web site](http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/display.cfm?id=7933596) if you don&#8217;t believe me.
