&#8220;Sir Oliver&#8217;s horse came ambling home to Oliver&#8217;s abode&#8221; 

I&#8217;ve been carrying that phrase around in my head for&#8230; a long time. Since Mrs Wilson, my secondary school maths teacher, put it in our heads as a mnemonic for remembering how sin, cos and tan are based on the [ratios of the sides of triangles](http://www.mathsrevision.net/gcse/sin_cos_tan.php) (scream if you want to go nerdier). Anyway, these last couple of days, for no obvious reason, I started wondering about the following meaningless questions:
  
Who was Oliver? How did he get his knighthood? What had he been doing to lose his faithful horse? Did it involve trigonometry? Maybe there&#8217;s a story there.
