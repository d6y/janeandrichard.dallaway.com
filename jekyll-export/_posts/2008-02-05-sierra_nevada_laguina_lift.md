For a while I&#8217;ve been meaning to record an entire lift run at a ski resort.
  
On [a trip to Sierra Nevada last March](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2007/03/weekend-snowboarding-at-sierra-nevada/), Jane decided to make the recording &#8212; presumably because she was bored of me mentioning it and forgetting to
  
do it.

Unfortunately she picked the longest lift run at [the resort](http://www.andalucia.co.uk/channels/sierra_nevada/sierranevadapistemap/). The original video
  
sequence was a finger chilling 10min 11sec, but you&#8217;ll be glad to know it&#8217;s been sped up here to just 2:10. There&#8217;s no sound on this clip, in case you were wondering if your sound was turned all the way down.

The only feature of interest here is that there&#8217;s a [radio telescope
  
at the top of a hill](http://www.osn.iaa.es/osn_eng.html). When riding with that in the background, you half
  
expect James Bond bad guys with automatic weapons to start chasing you on skidoos. Well, I do.
