From [The Traveler&#8217;s lunchbox](http://www.travelerslunchbox.com/journal/2006/8/21/calling-all-bloggers-things-to-eat-before-you-die.html) via [Amanda](http://savourysnark.blogspot.com/), 5 things to eat before you die inspired by the BBC&#8217;s [50 things to eat before you die](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/50eats_index.shtml) (I&#8217;ve got 10 left to try):
  
1. [Fish and chips](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/cornwall2005/206_0605/) (and [mushy peas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushy_peas) of course) from [Rick Stein&#8217;s fish and chip](http://www.rickstein.com/restaurants_steinsfishandchips.htm) shop in Padstow
  
2. Sausage and mash on a cold day
  
3. Chicken wings and ribs after a day snowboarding
  
4. Teriyaki salmon
  
5. Does chocolate count as food? If so, [Montezuma](http://www.montezumas.co.uk/)&#8216;s [giant buttons](http://www.montezumas.co.uk/search/showitem.asp?i=884)
