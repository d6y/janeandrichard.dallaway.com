I&#8217;ve just been catching up on some [BNM](http://www.brightonnewmedia.org/) posts from ages ago and [Mat](http://www.four0four.net/) posted a link to a [Mac Genius job opportunity in Churchill Square, Brighton](http://www.fish4.co.uk/iad/jobs/advert?adId=14858986& sid=s76F8BBAAA804906& pos=7& src=search& tot=50)

A bit of careful googling finds the following image, taken from the [Apple Store (United Kingdom)](http://www.apple.com/uk/retail/) page

I am going to have to hide Richard&#8217;s credit cards!!!
