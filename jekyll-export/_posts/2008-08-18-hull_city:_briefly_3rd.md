On Saturday afternoon [Hull City](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/default.stm) were briefly 3rd in the Premiership. I posted a picture when [we were 8th](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/06/hull_city_fixtures_2008/09) (pre-season) but here we are, one game in, and we&#8217;ve exceeded the pre-season position. Even after the weekend games, we&#8217;re still 5th.
