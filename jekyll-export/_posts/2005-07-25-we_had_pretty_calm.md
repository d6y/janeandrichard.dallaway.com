We had a pretty calm and relaxing weekend. Friday evening involved a few pints and some great food (as always) at [The Dorset](http://www.thedorset.co.uk/). And on Saturday we headed off to the impressive [Sand Sculpture Festival](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2005_07_23) followed by a couple of cocktails at the elegant [Black & White Cocktail Bar](http://www.aliashotels.com/alias_html/index.php?hotel=seattle&section=pleasure&sub_section=2) at [Hotel Seattle](http://www.aliashotels.com/alias_html/index.php?hotel=seattle&section=pleasure). Lovely!
