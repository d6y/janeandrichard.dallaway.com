[Pete](http://www.petebarrwatson.com/pm/weblog.php) mentioned a [Brighton Bloggers meetup](http://www.petebarrwatson.com/pm/comments.php?id=P247_0_1_0_536) a few days ago, and its starting to look like it might happen. So, I&#8217;ve offered the [BrightonBloggers.com](http://www.brightonbloggers.com/) space as a home for it where we hope to have details about meetups etc eventually. In the mean time there is just a list of all the Brighton Bloggers that were registered during the [Virtual Festival](http://www.virtualfestival.org.uk/).
