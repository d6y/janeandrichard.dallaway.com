I always used to use BT OpenWorld&#8217;s [Pixology](http://www.pixology.com/home/home.asp) service for getting prints from digital over the internet. When I tried to do this on Saturday I was informed that the service was no longer available. Richard pointed out that there is an [iPhoto](http://www.apple.com/uk/ilife/iphoto/) service linked to [Kodak](http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-locale=en_GB&pq-path=2/3&_requestid=30862) which does prints, so we investigated, discovered it was 14p per print cheaper than I used to pay and ordered some prints. They arrived today, so 5 days from ordering to receiving, including 2 weekend days and a bank holiday. Pretty impressive, and the quality is great too.
