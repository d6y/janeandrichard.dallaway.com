Whilst we were in Hull at the weekend we decided to buy a couple of spoken word tapes to amuse ourselves on the long drive back to Brighton (between 5 and 6 hours). We happened to be shopping in York and were in Waterstones, and so were limited to their selection. We chose a P G Wodehouse Jeeves and Wooster story ([The Inimitable Jeeves read by Simon Callow](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141801387/richarddallaway)) and a 4 episode collection ([Volume 5](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0563535202/richarddallaway)) of [Just a Minute](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/justaminute.shtml).

These really helped pass the time on the journey, and I am still in awe of the participants of Just a Minute. We&#8217;ve listened to 2 of the 4 episodes so far, and there were a good selection of participants &#8211; Clement Freud, Graham Norton, Linda Smith, Tony Hawkes, Paul Merton and Stephen Fry. There really is such a lot of skill involved (for those that don&#8217;t know, Just a Minute is a radio show where the contestants are given a subject to speak about for a minute during which they mustn&#8217;t hesitate, repeat themselves or deviate from the subject. It really is very hard, and the participants are very good at it (I&#8217;d have just failed for repetition of the word very there). I have high hopes for the other 2 episodes.

Jeeves and Wooster was an entertaining story and I enjoyed listening to it. It was very light, and didn&#8217;t need much concentration. It was kind of strange listening to Simon Callow reading it, as I always picture the Jeeves character as being Stephen Fry, and Hugh Laurie being Wooster following the TV series in which they both appeared.
