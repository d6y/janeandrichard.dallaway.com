Last night I went to the [camera club](http://www.photoclub.fsnet.co.uk/) [again](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2003/04/last_night_went_to), and again it was interesting. It was a competition, with an outside judge, [Jean Holmwood](http://www.touchingthelight.dial.pipex.com/features/jean2002.htm). The categories were &#8220;creative&#8221; as well as open sections for the Intermediate and Advanced groups. The creative slides included some that had been obviously digitally manipulated, and then created as a slide. At least one of these was manipulated, and displayed to full screen and then photographed with slide film (he hadn&#8217;t noticed that one of the photoshop icons was on the image &#8211; that was a bit of a giveaway really :-). It got me to thinking of other ways you could do this. Then I came home and started reading a magazine I&#8217;d bought the other day &#8220;[Digital Photographer](http://www.dphotographer.co.uk/)&#8221; for &#8220;enthusiasts and Pros&#8221;. On the letters page is a letter asking just that, how to get a digital file onto slide. The answer appears to be that there is a firm based in Nottingham, [Viva Imaging](http://www.procolour.co.uk) that will do that, and if you look for photo labs in your area, check them for &#8220;digital film recorder&#8221; services. So, at least I know that when I feel confident enough to submit images to these slide competitions, at least I will be able to do so.
