A few weeks back we attempted to cycle a chunk of the [South Downs Way](http://www.southdownsway.co.uk/), managing to do the 16-ish miles from our house to Falmer&#8212;which was a continuation for Jane and Jeremy of [the route they started 3 years ago](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_07_08/). You&#8217;d think once you got up onto the Downs it&#8217;s be relatively flat. But no&#8230;and to show it, here&#8217;s the elevation for the route we cycled:

Some of those climbs are impossible on a bike (well, for me). We need more practice on easier routes.

Which reminds me&#8230;back in September we were cycling an easier route along a different part of the downs and came across this [vandalized](http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2002/1/17/164941.html) structure along a [small track](http://www.voy.com/150967/34.html):

It reads: &#8220;John Harvey ESQ.
  
of Ickwell Bury in the Country of Bedford
  
died suddenly on this spot
  
on the 20th Day of June 1819.
  
This plaque commemorates
  
the restoration of
  
Harvey&#8217;s cross on the 20 June 1999
  
made possible through funding
  
by the Harvey family to
  
perpetuate John Harvey&#8217;s memory
  
and preserve the _something_
  
of downland.&#8221;

Makes you wonder who the person was, especially given that [Ickwell isn&#8217;t exactly close to Brighton](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?spn=1.980157,2.880615&saddr=brighton&daddr=ickwell&hl=en) (and the first rail line into Brighton wasn&#8217;t running until [1841](http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/ITbrighton.htm)). But unbelievably in this day and age, there&#8217;s very little information on the internet about it. Why commemorate the place where he died, far from home? Was he known to the area or a frequent visitor? Something as recent as the restoration in 1999 is not a simple google away, which is absurd.

Freakily, someone else was on the same spot one week before us and were [equally baffled](http://www.geograph.co.uk/photo/51715). 

My first thoughts were that it&#8217;d be something to do with the local [Harveys brewery](http://www.harveys.org.uk/), but I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s the case. I had to use a search engine other than google (gasp!) to find out anything. What I did find was [some family tree information](http://ourwebsite.org/jane/jane-p/p289.shtml): &#8220;Mr Harvey was a deputy-lieut. for Bedfordshire, and served as its high-sheriff in 1795. At the period of the French Revolution he raised and supported, chiefly at his own expense, a troop of volunteers, called the Dismounted Bedfor[d]shire Horse Artillery.&#8221; Hmm&#8230;Just makes it more intriguing. 

The cause of death is given as a fall from his horse, and [his will](http://www.higherbound.net/Gibbard/will_jh.htm) is online.
