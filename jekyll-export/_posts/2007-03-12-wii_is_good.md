I&#8217;m just here to confirm what you already know: the [Wii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii) is good. Good enough so that, on a sunny Sunday, with three FA cup games on TV, the family managed to spent 5hr 30min playing games on it. Good enough to cause my father to exclaim &#8220;Oh no, I&#8217;ve missed the [banana](http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermonkeyballbananablitz/review.html)&#8220;. Mind you, we all said that.

What does it for me is the social gaming combined with the physical elements of the games. But, with my geek hat on, I also have to say it&#8217;s one of those landmark things, like the PalmPilot, TiVo, P800, Mac OS X, and probably the iPhone: it&#8217;s not that you have to have it; it&#8217;s more that you can&#8217;t justify not buying it, because of the advance it represents.
