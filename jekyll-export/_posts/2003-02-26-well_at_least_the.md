Well, at least the councillers have [approved the West Pier restoration plans](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2801859.stm). The campaigners against the plans have vowed to fight on to [save their seafront views](http://www.saveourseafront.org.uk/). Personally, I believe if they protest too much the pier will beyond repair and will have to go &#8211; and that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d hate to see.
