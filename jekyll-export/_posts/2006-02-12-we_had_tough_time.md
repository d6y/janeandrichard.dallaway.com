We had a tough time of it trying to find a restaurant when
  
Mit&#252;l and Ash visited this weekend. All these places we called were full. We couldn&#8217;t understand why. One place didn&#8217;t have a table for four, but said they did have two tables for two. I think it took [a good cocktail](http://www.in-the-spirit.co.uk/cocktails/view_cocktail.php?id=86) to wake us up to the fact it&#8217;s the weekend before [Valentine&#8217;s day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day)&#8230;

About the photos: 1) The shop on Western Road only had one large sheep, and didn&#8217;t seem too keen to part with it. 2) After Ash and Mit&#252;l headed off to the station, we walked into the North Laine where a shop is selling plaster cast wall-mountable over-sized [Love Hearts](http://www.aquarterof.co.uk/love-hearts-p-394.html).
