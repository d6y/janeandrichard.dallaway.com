Forget the religion aspect: this is an absolute gem.

A couple of weeks ago, in Hull, Jane was introduced to the vicar who [christened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism) her. That seems a pretty rare event to me, but extraordinarily Jane&#8217;s christening was broadcast on the radio.

In 1972 [BBC Radio Humberside](http://www.bbc.co.uk/humber/local_radio/) were running a show called &#8220;In His Name&#8221;, and their broadcast of 15 October 1972 was from [the church in Hull](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&msa=0&msid=113137619056024517968.00045ebb06a0445e397d9) on the day Jane was being christened.

Back at Jane&#8217;s parent&#8217;s house we found the [C90 cassette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_cassette) that the station manager had recorded of the show. So, gather round, feel the full quality hiss of the tape: 36M [MP3 version](http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/audio/1972/InHisName.mp3) (or 35M [Ogg format](http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/audio/1972/InHisName.ogg), for you freedom lovers).
