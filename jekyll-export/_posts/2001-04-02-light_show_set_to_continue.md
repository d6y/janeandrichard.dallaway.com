Again, the [BBC Science and Technology](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1256000/1256112.stm) section are running a story indicating that the light show is likely to continue. Another flare was let off yesterday, which means there should be another display on Tuesday.

As predicted, observers in the UK got a poor show. The best place to be appeared to be western part of the USA.
