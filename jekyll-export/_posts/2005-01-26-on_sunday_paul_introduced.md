On Sunday, Paul introduced us to a short cycle route that has the benefit of getting you &#8220;off road&#8221; pretty quickly. At the top of Hove park there&#8217;s a narrow route you can take up-hill which leads to the A27/Devil&#8217;s Dyke roundabout. You cross the road from there and it&#8217;s all downhill through some woods back to the London road. Short, but sometimes that&#8217;s all you need.
