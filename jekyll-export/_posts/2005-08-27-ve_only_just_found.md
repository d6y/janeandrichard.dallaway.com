I&#8217;ve only just found [citystats.org](http://www.citystats.org), which gives information and maps for Brighton. The mapping is pre-google maps so it feels clunky, but on the other hand the data is Ordnanace Survey to 100m (meters) plus photos to that sort of level too. I couldn&#8217;t find any mention of [Jedis](http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=297) in the census data for religion, so that must have been bucketed into &#8220;other&#8221;. 

I stumbled on this while researching the [proposed changes](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1145785) to central Brighton parking, and how it would effect [our street](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1129328): &#163;3 per hour pay and display parking, double yellow lines elsewhere.
