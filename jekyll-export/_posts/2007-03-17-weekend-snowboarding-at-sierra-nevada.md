Jim and Lucy had shown interest in trying snowboarding, and as they own a [property](http://www.lacasadelolivar.com/) in Southern Spain the [Sierra Nevada](http://www.sierranevadaski.com/home) seemed like a good choice.

As beginners this was almost the perfect resort for Jim and Lucy as the Borreguiles area is really well set out with 6 different green runs served by 3 different lifts. We spent a couple of hours getting them started before heading off to see what the resort had to offer us. There wasn&#8217;t a lot of challenging terrain available (some areas were closed due to lack of snow or wind) but we had fun none the less.

Favourite run: maribel down to the base
