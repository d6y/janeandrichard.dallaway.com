Yesterday I went to the [Printwear and Promotion show](http://www.batiste.co.uk/2003/index.htm) at the NEC in Birmingham. As I said [last week](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2003/02/today_went_to_the), most of the conferences I&#8217;ve been to have been technical for technicians so this one was a complete change as there were lots of people selling print and embroidery machines as well as the new ranges from clothing suppliers. We went to see what was on offer for the Summer offering from [Igloo Life](http://www.IglooLife.com) and found some possible new suppliers to supplement what we already offer. It was a long day though, Brighton to Birmingham is a long drive when you only spend 3 hours at the show.
