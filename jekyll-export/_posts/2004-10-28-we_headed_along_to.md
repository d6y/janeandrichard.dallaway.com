We headed along to the [Brighton Bloggers](http://www.brightonbloggers.com/) meet up last night and caught up with [Jeremy](http://adactio.com/journal/), [Jonathan](http://assistantbrighton.blogspot.com/) and [Andrew](http://www.bedsitbomber.com/index.jsp). [Jeremy](http://adactio.com/journal/) and his band [Salter Cane](http://www.saltercane.com/) were playing at the Hanbury Ballroom as part of [Brighton Live week](http://www.thegildedpalaceofsin.com/shows2004/brightonlive_preview.htm).

It was a free event organised by the [Gilded Palace of Sin](http://www.thegildedpalaceofsin.com/) and was a really good evening. The first band on were [Homescience](http://www.homescience.co.uk/) &#8211; _&#8220;An unashamed pop band of maximum jangle&#8221;_, the second were [Threewheeler](http://www.threewheeler.i12.com/) &#8211; _&#8220;a quartet making a totally unorthodox, utterly unique music&#8221;_ and finishing with [Salter Cane](http://www.saltercane.com/downloads/) &#8211; _&#8220;an amalgam of NICK CAVE in gospel mode, WILLARD GRANT CONSPIRACY at their most dramatic, SIXTEEN HORSEPOWER&#8217;s lyrical darkness and the heaviness of JOY DIVISION&#8221;_.
