I forgot to say thanks to [Ray](http://www.visualabuse.com) and Helen for the poster. Helen had [a work](http://www.cinesite.com/) meeting with [the film](http://imdb.com/title/tt0371724/) director [Garth](http://imdb.com/name/nm1134029/) (that&#8217;s Mr Jennings to you) and he signed it for me. It&#8217;s great being a [fan](http://www.dallaway.com/reading/archive/lastchance.xml) sometimes. Sad, admittedly, but great nonetheless.
