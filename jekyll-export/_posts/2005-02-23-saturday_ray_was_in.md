Saturday: [Ray](http://www.visualabuse.com/) was in Brighton. The band he&#8217;s in, [loopjoy*](http://www.loopjoy.com/), were playing at the [Freebutt](http://www.ents24.com/web/venue/2376/Brighton/The_Freebutt.html) pub. We went along, and loopjoy (not sure if the * is mandatory) really are quite lovely live. The venue is great too: small but friendly, with a sound engineer who looked constantly baffled or hassled.
