I&#8217;ve been doing some work with [Nigel](http://www.nigelgordijk.co.uk/) on a site he&#8217;s designed, just doing some dhtml tinkering, and thought that before I started writing the code I&#8217;d see if I could find something that did at least some of what we wanted. Thanks to [Dynamic Drive](http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex5/linkinfo.htm) I&#8217;ve only had to make the content specific, everything else worked like a dream &#8211; across IE 6, Mozilla 1.4 and Safari 1. A [pretty useful site](http://dynamicdrive.com/), and some pretty useful code too.
