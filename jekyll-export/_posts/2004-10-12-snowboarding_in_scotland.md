I found [Highland-Instinct](http://www.highland-instinct.co.uk/index.html) today through [GoneBoarding](http://www.goneboarding.co.uk/). A great site reporting on the [snow conditions and ski resorts](http://www.highland-instinct.co.uk/scottishskicentres.htm) in Scotland. Shame that the [SkiClub historical snow reports](http://www.skiclub.co.uk/skiclub/reports/historical/report.asp) aren&#8217;t more favourable. Still, it might be worth a trip up if it looks like a good season this year and it would save another trip to [Milton Keynes Xscape](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2004/09/we_were_at_milton).
