We saw [Marisa and Erena](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/hamhouse/) the other week for a trip to Ham House, and while we were there Marisa handed me a copy of her latest book. You&#8217;ve [got a copy](http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4876150907), right? Well, flip to page 247 and there I am making guest appearance in unit 10: &#8220;Making an appointment with a GP&#8221;. Fame at last! Thank you Marisa. I going to try very hard to follow the script word-for-word the next time I need to phone my GP :-)&#8221;
