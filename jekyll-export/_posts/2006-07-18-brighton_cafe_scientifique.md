We went to the last of this season&#8217;s [Cafe Scientifique](http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/)s at the [Terraces](http://www.glendola.co.uk/terraces/index.asp) this evening. Tonight&#8217;s discussion was &#8220;[Bones, Rocks and Stars: the science of when things happened](http://www.christurney.com/brs_book.html)&#8221; given by [Chris Turney](http://www.christurney.com/). It was a really interesting talk, with props (inflatable globe, skulls etc) and promoted a really good discussion afterwards. This was the kind of science that I can cope with &#8211; some of them can be a bit too technical for me &#8211; but I always learn something. Tonight I learnt about the calendar system, and that the western astrological calendar is out of kilter with the constellations by approximately one month (see [Astrology vs Astronomy](http://www.deepermind.com/48Astrology.htm) and read the section on Zodiacs in Astrology). Also in [Ethiopia it is currently 1998](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_calendar)

One of the gentlemen we shared a table with was telling us about [The Royal Society](http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/) and about their [discussions](http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/landing.asp?id=4) which are open to the public. Apparently he went to a very interesting one on climate change a while ago and looking at their website they are have a wide range of topics. Maybe something to keep an eye on.

As we were heading home, Richard pointed out that I could enter into the [cult of mac](http://cultofmac.com/) and create an [iCal](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/) calendar for the Brighton Cafe Scientifique &#8211; so I have and it can be subscribed to at <webcal://ical.janeandrichard.co.uk/BrightonCafeScientifique.ics>
