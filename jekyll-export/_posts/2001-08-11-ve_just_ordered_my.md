I&#8217;ve just ordered my first replacement gadget. I&#8217;m getting a [Sony SRF M95 digital radio](http://www.sony.com.sg/consumer/consumer/Radio/srf_m95.html) to replace the mp3 player. I&#8217;ve ordered it from [Purley Radios Ltd](http://www.simplyradios.com/)and it should be with me in 5 to 7 working days.

One of the cheques that the insurance company sent was made out to one of the companies that some of the previous gadgets have been bought from. I called them to see if they could order this radio for me, but they said that they didn&#8217;t deal with anything other than computer equipment and so they weren&#8217;t prepared to order anything in for me. I&#8217;m going to call the Nationwide next week to see if they will re-adjust the cheques if I explain the circumstances.
