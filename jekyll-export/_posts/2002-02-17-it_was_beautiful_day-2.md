It was a beautiful day here in Brighton yesterday, and so the intrepid cyclists (that&#8217;s [Paul](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4085061691/in/set-72157622759196824/), [Rich](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4085805278/in/set-72157622634946179/) and [I](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4085871458/in/set-72157622759318274/)) went off for a new adventure. We did our first full route from the [CTC](http://www.ctc.org.uk)&#8216;s Trails by Rails collection. We headed off to Falmer by train, and then cycled along some lovely tracks.

The route was supposed to take 1 &#8211; 1.5 hours, but we think that the people who measured the tracks were a) fitter than us and b) cycling on less muddy and rutted tracks &#8211; in some places it was impossible to cycle as we couldn&#8217;t turn our pedals around without hitting the banks of the ruts. It ended up taking us 4 hours to do the trail, although according to Paul&#8217;s computer we were only actually cycling for 2 hours of that &#8211; we must have had lots of rest time.

We joined the South Downs Way part way through the trail, and got to watch some hang-gliders, paragliders and even a proper glider. As we cycled closer to the Ditchling Beacon car park there were more and more people walking along &#8211; I wonder how busy this will be during the summer months! All in all a really good ride, and one that I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll do again. See the [photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622759196824/).
