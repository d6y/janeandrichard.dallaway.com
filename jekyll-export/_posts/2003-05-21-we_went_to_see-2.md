We went to see [Horse Country](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/index.asp?id=464) at [Komedia](http://www.komedia.co.uk/) last night. It won some prizes at last years Edinburgh Festival, and boy did it deserve them. It&#8217;s a fast moving, conversational piece between &#8220;Bob&#8221; and &#8220;Sam&#8221;. It&#8217;s clever, and must be hard work for the actors. But, and here it comes, it wasn&#8217;t as funny as I&#8217;d expected it to be from the things I&#8217;d read. In fact, it was a bit hard work at times listening to the relentless string of words. Possibly the weirdest thing for us was that the guy who plays &#8220;Sam&#8221; had the same mannerisms, and words that [Jono](http://jonoabroad.blogspot.com/) has, which was somewhat surreal&#8230;

In our quest for a good Margarita somewhere that we don&#8217;t have to buy food as well (the only criticism of El Mexicano) we popped into [Quod](http://www.quod.co.uk/pages/Brighton.html), a new place, on our way home. The Margarita&#8217;s were ok, but not as good as [Sunday](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2003/05/food_blog)&#8216;s. Quod was ok, but it seemed a bit too London for our tastes. Still, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll eat there one day to check ðŸ™‚
