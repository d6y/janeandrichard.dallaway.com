I&#8217;m now a happy owner of a lovely [iPod Touch](http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/) and so headed off to the iTunes podcast directory in search of good video podcasts to make the most of my lovely new screen. I&#8217;ve no idea how I stumbled upon the [Vintage ToonCast](http://www.vintagetooncast.com/) but I&#8217;m happy I did. 

The image is from [Casper the friendly ghost](http://www.vintagetooncast.com/2006/02/15-casper-friendly-ghost_25.html), a sentimental cartoon that really appealed to me.

If anyone has any other recommendations for good video podcasts, then please let me know.<br clear="all" />
