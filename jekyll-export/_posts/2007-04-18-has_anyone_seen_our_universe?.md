Last night we went to [Cafe Scientifque](http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/) and heard [Bob Nichol](http://dsg.port.ac.uk/~nicholb/) talking about cosmology. 

It was quite a complex subject to talk about but Bob Nichol was excellent, very engaging, enthusiastic and able to explain things to those of us who haven&#8217;t studied science in over 20 years. I&#8217;m still too baffled to consider either the supernova that will cause earth to vapourise, or the fact that there might be [11 dimensions](http://superstringtheory.com/). It was also the biggest crowd I&#8217;ve seen at a Cafe Sci since it moved to the [Branch Tavern](http://www.brightonlife.com/brighton/pubs/branch-tavern-33.php) from the [Terraces](http://www.the-terraces.co.uk/).

It was also good to catch up [Dom](http://happygiraffe.net/blog/), [Sophie](http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/2007/04/dark-energy.html/) and [Tom](http://www.tomhume.org/).<br clear="all" />
