London is bidding for the 2012 olympics. Part of the plan (according to [BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/olympics_2012/3393681.stm)) involves using some of London&#8217;s famous landmarks as backdrops to events.

_&#8220;Suggestions have included beach volleyball in Horse Guards Parade and diving in Trafalgar Square. &#8220;_
