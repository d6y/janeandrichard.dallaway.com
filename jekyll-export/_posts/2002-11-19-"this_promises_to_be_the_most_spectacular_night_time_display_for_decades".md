I&#8217;ve just been out looking for the [Leonid meteor shower](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2481681.stm), but I saw nothing. Brighton&#8217;s too bright, there&#8217;s too much cloud and having an almost full moon can&#8217;t help. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen a meteor shower.

Now, do I set my alarm for 4am to see if the situation has changed? Mmmm&#8230; no.
