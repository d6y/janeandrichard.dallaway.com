Warning! You may find [britishpathe.com](http://www.britishpathe.com/) addictive.
  
Just browse their archive of film from the 1896 to the 1970s by hitting the &#8220;Lucky dip&#8221; button.
  
I&#8217;ve just been looking at images of Brighton&#8217;s West Pier from 1933. The preview of the clip gives you
  
some descriptive text, but to actually view the movie you need to fill out a form and then download
  
the (Windows) media file. The very low quality preview is free (oddly they email you an invoice)
  
and has a seriously annoying &#8220;(c) BRITISH PATHE PREVIEW ONLY&#8221; banner stuck 2/3 of the way down the screen for the whole movie.
  
Still, you can splash
  
out and buy the high-quality version if you really wanted to. 

Promisied for spring this year: 12 million still images.
