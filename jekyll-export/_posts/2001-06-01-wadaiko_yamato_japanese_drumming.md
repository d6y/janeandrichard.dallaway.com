[Wadaiko Yamato](http://www.wadaiko-yamato.com/NewFiles/english-site2001/main-e.html) &#8211; a Japanese drumming phenomenen &#8211; are performing at the Peacock Theatre in London at the moment. We went last night with some friends and were all extremely impressed. I didn&#8217;t know what to expect never having seen any Japanese drumming shows before but it was far more lively and humorous than I had expected. There are some very talented people in the show &#8211; and they are all very fit too.

So, if you see adverts for a Wadaiko Yamato show near you &#8211; take the chance and go and see it.
