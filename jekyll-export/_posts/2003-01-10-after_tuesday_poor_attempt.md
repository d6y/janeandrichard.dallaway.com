After Tuesday&#8217;s [poor attempt at moon photography](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_01_07/crw_4176_rj/) I decided to find out a bit more about it and read an article on [photo.net](http://www.photo.net/nature/sunmoon), one on [dpFWIW](http://www.cliffshade.com/dpfwiw/moon.htm) and got some advice from the [forums on dpreview](http://forums.dpreview.com/forums). So this evening, as I left the office I decided to try a few of the suggestions. I&#8217;m planning to experiment with a few other settings next time, but I&#8217;m much happier with what I got here.
