Jane found [SLIMP3](http://www.slimp3.com), which is a little bit of hardware and some open source software that plays MP3s from our server through our home stereo. It&#8217;s great, and we&#8217;re not the only ones [to think so](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2002/12/11/slimp3.html). I had to add an [ethernet to wireless bridge](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000088UJR/richarddallaway) to stream the music wirelessly, but that worked perfectly too. I&#8217;m happy.
