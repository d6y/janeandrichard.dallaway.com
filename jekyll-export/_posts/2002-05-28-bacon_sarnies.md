One day last week [Susie](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/susieleaving1/img_1897_640_bw-bw/) was complaining about being hungry and wanting lunch. It was 10am. We sent her over the road to our local greasy spoon to get a bacon buttie. She returned with sandwiches for all, and my bacon and mushroom sarnie was lovely and possibly one of the best I&#8217;ve ever had. Today, the weather is horrid (raining and windy and generally yuck) and we needed comfort food, and so we had bacon sandwiches for lunch. I was going to miss this and stick to the lunch I&#8217;d brought with me, but then realised that I couldn&#8217;t sit in an office with 3 people eating lovely, lardy, bacon butties. So, I gave in.
