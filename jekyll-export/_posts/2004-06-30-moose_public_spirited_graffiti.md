[Moose, public-spirited graffiti artist, cleans up](http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/story.jsp?story=535331): &#8220;His method is to take any dirty inner-city wall or pavement, place a template over it and scrub the concrete clean, revealing an image as sharp as any spray paint&#8221;. 

I don&#8217;t know what it is, but something about this story makes me feel like we&#8217;re living in a [William Gibson](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/index.asp) novel.
