Last month [Cayne](http://cayne.blogspot.com/) and [Frauke](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2005_11_05/206_0653_r1/) visited. We&#8217;d not seen Cayne [since 2001](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/nz/), and it was was the first time we&#8217;d met Frauke, so that was all just lovely. Their trip coincided with the Lewes Bonfire celebrations, and as it was on a Saturday we managed to drag the New Scientist [posse](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/eyemodule/extremeealing.html) out too. [Photos are available](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2005_11_05/). 

I&#8217;ll leave it to Cayne or Frauke to mention &#8220;the incident&#8221; if they want to sometime.
