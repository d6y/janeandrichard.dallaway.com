We were in London last night attending an [ecademy](http://www.ecademy.com) event. The event wasn&#8217;t great, but it was good to meet up with some friends. On the way home we noticed the above sign for a play: [The Madness of George Dubya](http://www.themadnessofgeorgedubya.org/). You can&#8217;t quite make it out, but on the far left it says &#8220;re-written daily&#8221;. No idea what the show&#8217;s like, but nice title.
