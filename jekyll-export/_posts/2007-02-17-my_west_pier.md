I received the following email regarding some of the [photos](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_01_28/) of the aftermath of the West Pier [collapses](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2002-12-30/img_3956/) and [fire](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_03_28/) and the [My West Pier](http://mywestpier.com/) project. 

_Dear Jane and Richard_,

_I saw your photos of the driftwood of the West Pier&#8217;s Concert Hall&#8230;_

_I am an architecture student at the Technical University of Berlin. Brighton&#8217;s West Pier is my diploma project._

_My approach to the project is in short that if you want to rebuild the West Pier, it is necessary to collect the missing parts, the flotsam and jetsam, and reassemble them. Flotsam might not just be the driftwood at Brighton Beach, it may also be your stories and your visions of the pier._

_I made two appeals in the newspaper &#8216;The Argus&#8217;:_

_&#8220;1. I want you, who took some flotsam of the collapsed and stranded Concert Hall, to take a photo of your part of the pier, where you have installed it now and send the photo via email to <you@mywestpier.com>!_

_2. If you took a part of the pier, you must offer a part of your home to build a new pier. Please look for the piece of furniture you would like to be part of a new pier, take a photo and send it to <you@mywestpier.com>!&#8221;_

_Maybe you can help me, because you have obviously been there!_

_Many thanks and regards from rainy Berlin,_

_Jannes_ 

If anyone has any images to help Jannes, please send them on to him at the email address he mentions above.
