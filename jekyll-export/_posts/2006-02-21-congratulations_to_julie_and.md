Congratulations to Julie and Craig on a great party with some lovely people, oh, and also on getting married. A roast for dinner (mmmm) and the band were cracking. Later, when the disco kicked off, being the designated driver, I was able to contemplate the physics of &#8220;[It&#8217;s raining men](http://www.lyricsondemand.com/onehitwonders/itsrainingmenlyrics.html)&#8220;, and I conclude it&#8217;s messy. Ah-uhuh. 

What else&#8230; plenty of men in kilts, which was possibly something to do with [their surname](http://www.spatial-literacy.org/UCLnames/Map.aspx?name=PATERSON&year=1998&altyear=1881&country=GB&type=name). Allegedly the best man would show you the contents of his kilt if you asked nicely. How friendly&#8217;s that?!
