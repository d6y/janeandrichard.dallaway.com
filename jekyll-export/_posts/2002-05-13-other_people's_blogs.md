For one reason or another I&#8217;ve read a few other people&#8217;s blogs recently, and I thought it was only fair to give them a mention. 

  * [BostonBlueEyes](http://bostonblueyes.blogspot.com/) tells about the exploits of Colin and the lovely D. It&#8217;s well written and quite interesting, and he was kind enough to publish a blog entry especially for us the other week.
  * I followed a link from BostonBlueEyes to [Amethyst](http://www.amethyst85.blogspot.com/) and found it quite interesting reading about Karen&#8217;s trip to the UK. Sounds like she had a great time.
  * As mentioned before [[1](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/06/neil_gaiman_co_author)][[2](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/09/still_reading_neil_gaiman)][[3](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/10/read_neil_gaiman_site)], I still read [Neil Gaiman](http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/journal.asp)&#8216;s blog. I still find him amusing, and Richard bought me the book &#8220;[American Gods](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747263744/richarddallaway)&#8221; for my birthday so I&#8217;m looking forward to reading that &#8211; the last Neil Gaiman book I read was &#8220;[Good Omens](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552137030/richarddallaway)&#8221; &#8211; a joint effort between Neil and Terry Pratchett.
  * I stumbled across [Winter Wonderland](http://michele.digikym.com/) when I searched google for wedding related blogs and check back every now and again to see what they&#8217;re up to. They get married very soon indeed so Good Luck Michele and Allen.
  * I used to read a GadgetGirl blog, by [Suey](http://suey.org.uk) but she seems to have fallen off the edge of the internet.
  * And not forgetting [SpunkyTheMonkey](http://www.spunkythemonkey.co.uk/brainspew.asp) and the infrequently updated [Jocke](http://jocke.selincite.com/currently.php) &#8211; both of whom I used to work with at [Aspect](http://www.aspectgroup.co.uk), and of course [Daisy](http://www.daisyevans.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/diary1.html) whose Mummy I worked with there as well.
