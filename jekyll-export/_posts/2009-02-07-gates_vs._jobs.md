Justing thinking: although I&#8217;m a MacOS X fanatic, and officially dispassionate with respect to Windows (unofficially I&#8217;d use a stronger word), Bill Gates could turn out to be the bigger geek hero in the long run. _What?_ I just mean [the stuff he&#8217;s doing now](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/annual-letter/Pages/2009-annual-letter-introduction.aspx) has all the promise of turning out to be monumental.

Of course, maybe not enough to undo all suffering his company has caused. Time to go re-watch that [Gates vs. Jobs video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrGruc9iGIU)&#8230;
