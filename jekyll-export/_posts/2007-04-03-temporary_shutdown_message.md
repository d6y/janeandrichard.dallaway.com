When doing a recent check on all the blogs at [Brighton Bloggers](http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blogs/), I spotted this message at the [Brighton and Hove councillors](http://www.brighton-hove-councillors.org.uk/index.cfm?request=a1700) site. Amongst other things it says
  
&#8220;_During the six week period prior to local and general elections, there is a ban in place on publicising the work of councillors to unfairly influence votes. Because of this, all of the pages and councillor blogs on this website are to be temporarily suspended until after the elections have finished._&#8220;<br clear="all" />
