A new feature for [iTunes 7](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) is the ability to transfer purchased music from an iPod to a desktop &#8211; as long as the purchaser of the music is authorised on your machine. I discovered this by accident when I plugged my [shuffle](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/shuffle.xml) into my PC at work to put some files on it before heading home for the weekend. When I plugged it in a dialog appeared offering me a new option to &#8220;Transfer Purchases&#8221;, I figured I&#8217;d give it a try and it copied all the purchased music on my shuffle onto my PC. Great. So, I headed off home and decided to plug our main iPod into my macbook and see what happened. No pop up dialog, but if I control click on the name of our iPod I get a menu which offers &#8220;Transfer Purchases&#8221;. Very cool! This will save me cutting CDs to transfer our purchases from one machine to another.
