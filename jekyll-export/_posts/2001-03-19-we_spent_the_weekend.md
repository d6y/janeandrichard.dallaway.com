We spent the weekend in Aberystwyth (Wales, UK). Not sure why really. Hadn&#8217;t been there before. Jane might write up a [travelogue](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/index.html) but for now we have some&#8221;
  
[eyemodule photos](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/eyemodule/index.html#Wales).

While researching the trip I found [virtualhotels.com](http://www.virtualhotels.com/), which is handy for narrowing down the choice of hotels in an area. Then you need to jump off to [Google](http://www.google.com/) or [similar](http://www.metacrawler.com) to get extra information about
  
a place. 

We ended up at [Conrah Country House Hotel](http://www.conrah.co.uk/index.html). Nice place. Great service. Recommended. &#8220;Helicopter arrivals may be accommodated by prior arrangement with the hotel&#8221;. Of course. We may get addicted to [luxury hotels like the Conrah](http://www.johansens.com/stay.html).
