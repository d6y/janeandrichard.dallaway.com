This morning, at around 9am, some of the [West Pier collapsed into the sea](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2612805.stm). We didn&#8217;t know anything about it until it was mentioned on the 5pm news so we&#8217;ve not been down to see it. Probably will do tomorrow though armed with the camera. There has been a lot of discussion about the [future of the West Pier](http://www.westpier-trust.demon.co.uk/restoration.html), this looks like it might do away with the restoration plans which is a real shame as I think it&#8217;s a [beautiful building](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/brightonphotoday/img_0981_640/).
