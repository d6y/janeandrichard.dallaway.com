I bought myself an FM transmitter for my [iPod shuffle](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/shuffle.xml) last week. I found that I was only using the shuffle when I was on the bus or train and that seemed to be a bit of a shame, not to mention that my collection of podcasts was getting out of hand. So, I did a bit of a search and found a couple of likely suspects, the [AudiaX iTube-101](http://www.digiana.com/product/itube101.php) and [FM Transmitter for iPod nano, iPod shuffle and video iPod](http://shop.ipodworld.co.uk/iPodWorldSite/product/iPod_Shuffle_FM%20Transmitters/AU02/FM_Transmitter_for_iPod_Nano_iPod_Shuffle_and_video_iPod.htm). The second one is quite interesting as it just plugs into the headphone jack, and so would work with any portable music device, the downside is that it needs an AAA battery. The AudiaX one works off the cigarette lighter connected to the USB port and so takes its power from that, as well as charging the shuffle. This does, however, only work with the shuffle. I&#8217;ve chosen the AudiaX version as I just can&#8217;t face buying so many batteries. So far the solution is working well for me, there are 4 memory locations for the frequency so I can just swap between them as I move between areas. I&#8217;ve now finished listening to the [Baddiel and Skinner world cup podcasts](http://www.baddielandskinner.com/), and have moved on to the [ITV Tour de France podcasts](http://download.itv.com/tour/podcast.xml).
