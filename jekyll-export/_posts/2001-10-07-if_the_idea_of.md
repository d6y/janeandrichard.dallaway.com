If the idea of [Kylie Minogue](http://www.kylie.com/) flying around as a [sexy fairy](http://www.animallogic.com/film/moulinrouge/greenfairy.html) seems about right, and you like the thought
  
of [Jim Broadbent](http://www.jim.broadbent.org/) singing a [baritone](http://www.essentialsofmusic.com/glossary/b.html) version of
  
[Madonna](http://www.madonnamusic.com/)&#8216;s [Like a Virgin](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~kennyz/madonna_lyrics/like.a.virgin.html#likeavirgin), then you really should go and see [Moulin Rouge!](http://www.clubmoulinrouge.com/) at the cinema. We loved it (Drama/Musical/Romance&#8230; but don&#8217;t let that put you off).
