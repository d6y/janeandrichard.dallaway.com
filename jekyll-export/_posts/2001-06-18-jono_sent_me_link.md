Jono sent me a link to [300 Miles High](http://www.kokogiak.com/300miles/) &#8212; a collection of NASA images
  
taken from orbit. He knew I&#8217;d like it because I have a collection of similar images in my copy of
  
[Orbit: NASA Astronauts Photograph the Earth](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0792237145/richarddallaway). 

The good thing about the book is that it has the captions to go with the images, explaining what you&#8217;re looking at (&#8220;The Trans-Siberian Railroad draws a line through the April snow east of the Ural Mountains&#8221;&#8230;. or &#8220;Each of these green circles is 200 acres of farmland&#8221;&#8230; or &#8220;&#8230;this is a rare clear view of Tokyo &#8212; 30 million people compressed into the ancient Japanese heartland, the Edo Plain of Honshu&#8221;&#8230; etc, etc, only the descriptions are typically two or three paragraphs, not one sentence). Shame the web site doesn&#8217;t have the captions.
