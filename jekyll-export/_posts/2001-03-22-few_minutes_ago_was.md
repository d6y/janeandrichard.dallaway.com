A few minutes ago I was trying to get to my bank in
  
[Soho Square](http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?G2M?X=529648&Y=181214&A=Y&Z=1)
  
and I saw the Queen (of England) and Prince Phillip.

There was a crowd of people and lots of police and it looked like someone
  
was visiting the Tucan pub. Then I spotted the [Royal Standard](http://www.royal.gov.uk/faq/flag.htm) flying on a car, and realized
  
it was the Queen and she was visiting something opposite the pub.

I was trying to make my way through the crowd and she stepped out
  
from a building, waved, there was some clapping and cheering, then
  
she got into a car and was driven away. Show over.
