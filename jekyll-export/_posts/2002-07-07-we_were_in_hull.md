We were in Hull at the weekend (see the [wedlog](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedlog/archive/2002_07_01_index.xml#78659573)) and were doing some shopping at [Princes Quay](http://www.princes-quay.co.uk/). We noticed a lot of canoeists in the water that surrounds the shopping centre, and it turned out to be the [Hull International Canoe Polo competition](http://www.geocities.com/hull_canoepolo/). Now we&#8217;d never seen Canoe Polo before, and the first game we watched was a ladies game and it was really interesting. Later in the afternoon, after we&#8217;d finished shopping, we stopped and watch a couple of the mens games, and were amazed at how aggressive, fast and enjoyable to watch they were. The Hull event seems to be an annual event, so hopefully we&#8217;ll remember to keep an eye out for it next year and go and watch some more games.
