I was amazed that I could get [GPRS service](http://www.google.com/search?q=define:gprs) on my phone while in [Canada](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/Canada2004/bigwhite/). GPRS meant I could send and receive email. Ok, it wasn&#8217;t terrible fast 5,760ft up in [the middle of nowhere](http://www.bigwhite.com/submenus/BigWhiteMaps/mapdisplay.php?map_id=driving), but it worked, so naturally I [bcc:ed](http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Abcc) a few people photos I&#8217;d taken with the phone. So much more personal than a default postcard, [IMHO](http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/I/IMHO.html). And faster. Probably not cheaper. 

Today I received the same back from a friend on holiday in Greece, so I can confirm that, on the receiving side, I prefer this to postcards.
