Tonight Jane almost had me in tears. We were listening to [Electric Landlady](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000I25G/richarddallaway) and Jane said: &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d forgotten [Kirsty MacColl](http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/) was [dead](http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/news/cozumel.htm). I was just thinking it was about time for another album&#8221;. I&#8217;d erased that fact.. Most upsetting.

Anyway&#8230; yesterday afternoon I was at [Linux Expo](http://www.linuxexpo.co.uk/) at Olympia in London. Mostly dull and very quiet. They had someone walking around in a giraffe costume. I can only assume the hire shop ran out of [penguin](http://www.sjbaker.org/tux/) outfits and substituted something they thought would be alright. But hey, I got to catch up with [Dave](http://www.hodgkinson.org/) and see what he&#8217;s [up to](http://www.slashrock.com/).

In the evening I caught up with Jane and the [New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com) folk for [some beers](http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/view_review_details.asp?Version=Pubbar&ReviewID=775) and then we headed off to [Akbar](http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/view_review_details.asp?Version=Pubbar&ReviewID=1121) to Suran&#8217;s pre-show party for [anjali](http://www.suran.net). Drank too much, way too much passive smoking, but we had fun.
