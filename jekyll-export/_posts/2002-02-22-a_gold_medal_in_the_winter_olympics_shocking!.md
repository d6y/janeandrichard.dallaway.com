Well, I sat and watched the Women&#8217;s [Curling](http://news.bbc.co.uk/winterolympics2002/hi/english/static/winter_olympics/event_guide/curling.stm) final in the Winter Olympics. I still aren&#8217;t sure of the rules, or the strategy and tactics of the game, but by the time it got to 3 &#8211; 3 and it was the final end of the match, I was really sitting up and taking notice. For a sport that I&#8217;ve never really tried to watch before, it got me pretty hooked &#8211; admittedly I wouldn&#8217;t have been watching it if it was a British (ok, ok, Scottish) team in the final. But, they won and that was the first Gold medal that Britain has won in a Winter Olympics in 18 years. And, combined with the Bronze medal for Alex Coomber in the Skeleton Bob, this makes these Winter Olympics the best for Britain since 1936!!!

Well Done Team Great Britain.
