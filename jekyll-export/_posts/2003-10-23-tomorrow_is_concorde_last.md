Tomorrow is [Concorde&#8217;s last flight](http://www.concorde-jet.com/). I think this is a shame, as **a)** it was (and still is) a great technological achievement, and **b)** I haven&#8217;t flown on it. We were talking about this at work today, and I remembered that I&#8217;ve stood on a Concorde, and looked in the cockpit, and sat in one of the seats, but I haven&#8217;t flown on it. After leaving uni I worked for Speedwing Logica for a few years, and when we had a day trip to the office before starting work we were taken around Heathrow and shown around a newly kitted out 747 and a Concorde. My memories of Concorde are that it was very small, the cockpit was very low tech in comparison to the fly-by-wire 747.
