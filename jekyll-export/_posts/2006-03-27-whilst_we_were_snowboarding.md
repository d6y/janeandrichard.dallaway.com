Whilst we were [snowboarding in Colorado](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/colorado2006/index.html) recently, we hired some demo kit to see what, if any, a difference it made.

The first board I hired was a [Ride Kashmir 151](http://www.ridesnowboards.com/boards/board.asp?ProductID=12) which I loved. I kept my [own bindings](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2004/04/my_snowboard_bindings_arrived) as [Breckenridge Sports](http://www.breckenridgesports.com/document_display.cfm?document_id=13177) only had standard Burton bindings. The board suited me well, and I found it a lot less shaky on flats. It didn&#8217;t take long to adjust to and I had great fun with it.

The second board was a [Salomon Ivy 151](http://www.salomonsnowboard.com/uk/products/products.asp?id=784107) with some [Burton Mission bindings](http://www.burton.com/eu/gear/products.asp?productID=86). The girl in [Breeze rentals](http://www.breezeski.com/index.php) recommended the Ivy as a great rental board, but didn&#8217;t think it would make a good board to buy as they&#8217;ve seen a lot of damaged returns. Apparently the Ivy is due for a re-release next year and it might be worth following up on then. The bindings were great and the board felt really responsive.

Looks like I&#8217;m in the market for a Ride Kashmir then&#8230;
