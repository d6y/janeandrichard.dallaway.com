Since [ITVDigital](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/tv_and_radio/newsid_1961000/1961782.stm)&#8216;s [shutdown](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1961000/1961209.stm) in the last couple of days, we&#8217;ve lost quite a few TV channels. It may be coincidence, but [TiVO](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml) has gone mad and has started recording all sorts of rubbish, such as [Richard and Judy](http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/R/richardandjudy/), [Newsround Lite](http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/) (ok, not rubbish, but not something we need recording), and various other day-time TV junk. Poor thing must be desperate for things to record for us. Bless.
