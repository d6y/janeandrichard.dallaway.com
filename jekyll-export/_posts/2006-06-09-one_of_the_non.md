One of the non-spam emails I had waiting for me was about a new Brighton based site [Green Brighton](http://greenbrighton.com/index.php) which uses google maps to be a directory of all things green in Brighton &#8211; &#8220;_vegetarian and vegan restaurants, organic veg boxes, recycling centers, permaculture gardens and meditation classes_&#8220;. Looks like it could become a good resource.
