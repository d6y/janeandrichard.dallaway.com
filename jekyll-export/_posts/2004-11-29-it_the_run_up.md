It&#8217;s the run up to Christmas, and so on Saturday we headed off to the [Cite Europe](http://www.cite-europe.com/prod/index.jsp?pays=2) shopping centre in Calais to stock up on cheaper booze (with hundreds of other brits judging by how busy the place was).

We used the [Eurotunnel again](http://www.eurotunnel.co.uk/ukcmain), and again were impressed with it. The fact that it is less than 5 minutes from the terminal to Cite Europe is pretty handy too and even the return trip only took us about 20 minutes (although you do wonder where they&#8217;re taking you as you can see the terminal from the East Car Park).

We bought most of our alcohol from [Tesco](http://www.tesco-france.com/frame.asp?rub=&main=home&left=left) &#8211; using the [Superplonk](http://www.superplonk.com/) data to work out what the best deals were. We managed to track down enough to keep us going for a while anyways. One thing we noticed was that Tesco&#8217;s do an [ordering service](http://www.tesco.com/vinplus/ListePrix.pdf) &#8211; we might give that a try next time.

We stopped for lunch in [Le Moulin a Biere](http://www.lemoulinabiere.com/) (getting 10% off because we&#8217;d been to Tescos) and then had a good wander around the rest of the shops, and finished off in [Carrefour](http://www.carrefour.com/english/homepage/index.jsp) buying some cheese, and a few more bottles of wine.
