I had to go for my eye test the other week, and as it had been over 3 years since I got new glasses (being a mainly contact lens wearer) I figured it was time to find some. I really don&#8217;t enjoy shopping for glasses, as I find the choices daunting and I have no idea of what style/shape/colour etc I should be selecting. In the end I dragged a friend along and on her recommendation we went to [Bromptons](http://www.realbrighton.com/company/308) in [Gardner Street](http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?pc=BN1+1UN&title=Bromptons+Opticians&scale=5000). Such good service, the guy had time to help, offer advice, make recommendations on what would look good and what I should avoid. I walked away with the first pair of [glasses](http://www.boothandbruce.com/) that I think I&#8217;ve ever been really happy with.
