I had possibly the most impressive buying-to-delivery online shopping experience the other day. On Wednesday evening I ordered something from [Things to Engrave](http://www.thingstoengrave.co.uk). It was a silverplated item which was to be engraved with a message. This morning, Friday, it arrived. So, that&#8217;s under one business day to turn it around. I&#8217;m really impressed by that.
