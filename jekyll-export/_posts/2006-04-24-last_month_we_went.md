Last month we went to see [Terry Garoghan](http://www.juicebrighton.com/terry.html)&#8216;s [Brighton The Musical](http://www.terrygaroghan.com/show.html). I saw him perform _Worthing_, to the tune of _Wild Thing_, at the Crocodile Comedy club in the early 90s I suppose, but I didn&#8217;t realize it had grown it into a full-blown musical. Too many great songs to pick a favourite. I&#8217;d call the whole thing quite silly and wonderful, but others say it is &#8220;[proper unpretentious, working-class humour at its best](http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2006/3/27/209236.html)&#8220;. I should go and buy [the](http://www.terrygaroghan.com/cd2004.html) [CDs](http://www.terrygaroghan.com/cd2000.html) (which will make no sense to anyone who doesn&#8217;t know Brighton fairly well).
