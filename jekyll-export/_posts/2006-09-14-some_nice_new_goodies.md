Some nice new goodies from Apple were [announced on Tuesday](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html), movies via [iTunes 7](http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/download/), [new look iPod nano](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodnano/), [new look iPod shuffle](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodshuffle/) (so small&#8230;.) and the [iTV](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5339470.stm) unit (yet to be given a proper name). I didn&#8217;t watch all of the [event broadcast](http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/sep_2006/event/index.html) (partially due to the poor audio quality of the presentation, which when combined with the [poor speakers in the macbook](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=macbook+poor+speakers&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) made it almost impossible to hear over the rain hammering on the roof outside).

I downloaded the new iTunes yesterday and quite a few of the user interface features look nice, although as with all things will take some getting used to. I connected my, sadly out of date now, [shuffle](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/shuffle.xml) and looked at the settings tab and found the following at the bottom of the page.

Cute!
