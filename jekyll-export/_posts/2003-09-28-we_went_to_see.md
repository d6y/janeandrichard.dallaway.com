We went to see [Whale Rider](http://www.whaleriderthemovie.com/) this afternoon at the [Duke of Yorks](http://www.dukeofyorkscinema.com/). A beautiful, moving film, and served to the accompaniment of free [Ben and Jerrys](http://www.benandjerrys.com/) ice cream. What could be better. Big thanks to the Vic, Kaye, Jeremy and Rachel for recommending it to us.
