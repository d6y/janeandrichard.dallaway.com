Since [buying a Mac](http://www.apple.com/switch/stories/markfrauenfelder.html)
  
back in [July](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2003/07/going_to_try_to) I&#8217;ve become
  
everything I swore I&#8217;d never become: [a Mac bore](http://www.applelinks.com/articles/2003/01/20030124155752.shtml),
  
banging on about Mac this and Mac that, and how all Windows
  
users are wasting their lives. I don&#8217;t know how
  
this happened. I suppose I&#8217;m just more
  
optimistic when I use a Mac. Or maybe I&#8217;m a sucker for the marketing.
  
Either way, things seem better. Anyway&#8230;a
  
couple of days ago my Mac died on me: hardware
  
problems, and it&#8217;s heading back to the mother ship to get
  
some of that [crashed saucer
   
technology](http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02000-04-21&l=169#l)
  
refitted. So &#8220;up to seven working days&#8221; of life back
  
in the Windows world for me. It&#8217;s not a shock, it&#8217;s just&#8230; harder.
  
Windows does pretty much all the same things, but in a more complicated, gets-in-the-way, kind
  
of style. There are a zillion dull tiny details, but they add
  
up to quite a different experience.
  
Ok, there I go again. So, time for a late new year&#8217;s resolution: don&#8217;t mention
  
how great Apple machines are ever again. Let&#8217;s see how long that lasts&#8230;
