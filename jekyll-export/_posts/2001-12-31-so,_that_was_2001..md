We started the year in [New Zealand](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/nz2001.html) for just under 3 weeks (and didn&#8217;t really get a New Years day). We spent a lot of time driving around both the North and the South Islands, and got a good feel for the country. We had a lot to think about when we came back as we really liked Auckland, and were offered jobs there, this led to the question should we emigrate? The discussions about this went on until at least March, and we ended up going to [Wales](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/wales.html) for a weekend to discuss it more. Eventually we decided not to go as most of our friends are busy producing children at the moment and so wouldn&#8217;t be able to visit us. We still plan to return to New Zealand at some point for a longer time, and so we can do some of the exploring we didn&#8217;t get to do this time.

In April time we decided it was time to move house, and so we started looking for houses &#8211; in Brighton! We&#8217;d decided that Brighton had many of the aspects we were looking for in a City.

The whole process of buying a house and selling the flat was painful, and it felt that anything that could go wrong, did. What with management agents who were a bit useless, solicitors who were very, very picky, and a [bomb](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1476000/1476586.stm) going off in Ealing town centre it took us until August to [move](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/ealing2brighton/).

In July we went to Pembrey in Wales to learn how to [parakart](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/pembrey/). This was really good fun and we ended up buying a traction kite not long afterwards.

In late November, I was made redundant from Aspect, the place where I&#8217;d worked for the past 2 years. I got to spend most of December at home doing some geek playing with PHP and MySQL, and managed to find a new job which starts in January (and is in nearby Portslade so I won&#8217;t need to sit on a Thameslink train for 3.5 hours per day).

I spent a very enjoyable Christmas in Brighton, and even managed a walk on the beach on [Christmas Day](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/christmasday2001/).

So, its now New Years Eve and we&#8217;re disapointed to find out that there are no special events laid on by the council. So, we&#8217;ve had to buy some fireworks from a [very knowledgable guy](http://www.theinternetpages.co.uk/england/brigh/fworks1/pyro.htm) who sold us a selection of rockets and fireworks. We&#8217;re planning to let them off down at the beach at some appropriate cold point this evening.
