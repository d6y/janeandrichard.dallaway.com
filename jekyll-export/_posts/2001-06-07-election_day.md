It&#8217;s a general election day in the UK today, and I&#8217;ve still not fully decided who to vote for yet. I _will_ vote, but will probably decide as I walk to the polling station on my way to work. Even the [Who Do I Vote For](http://www.whodoivotefor.co.uk/) website couldn&#8217;t help me decide who I should vote for as it told me 2 of them were of equal relevance to me. I could always try and get tactical with my voting ([Tactical Voter](http://www.tacticalvoter.net/)) but for [my area](http://www.tacticalvoter.net/tactical/Results.tmpl?sectormatch=&iebugfix=074502&db=databases/busi.db&display=sector&geskudata=0&max=50&wordmatchtype=eq&fieldinputname=Constituency~T&searchcriteria=Ealing%2520Acton%2520%2526%2520Shepherd%2527s%2520Bush) they have no recomendation as it is a &#8220;safe&#8221; labour seat. So, if I want to vote for someone other than Labour, my vote won&#8217;t really count for much (we don&#8217;t have proportional representation in the UK yet &#8211; sign [this petition](http://callfordemocracy.org/vote.html)). The major parties just don&#8217;t see that different any more, there aren&#8217;t huge gaps between them at the moment.
