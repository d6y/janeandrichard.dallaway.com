Fingers crossed, we&#8217;re off to Brighton (coastal UK town),
  
so our flat in London is [for sale](http://www.propertyfile.co.uk/home/quick/PFdetails.asp?cl=151&pid=4532711). 

I&#8217;ve put the full estate agent&#8217;s [details on-line](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/eatonrise/) (direct from Word, so sorry for the layout).
