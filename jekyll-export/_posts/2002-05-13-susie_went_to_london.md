Susie went to London on Saturday to do a few more touristy things, see a show and have dinner with her brother. Whilst she was there she popped into [Fortnum and Mason](http://www.fortnumandmason.com/fm_prod/main.cfm)&#8216;s. Being the sweetie that she is, she bought me a tin of Fortnum and Mason&#8217;s Drinking Chocolate Flakes. So, this afternoon, an afternoon when it&#8217;s wet and miserable outside, we&#8217;ve just been drinking some. And it&#8217;s lovely. It&#8217;s actually flakes of chocolate, not a powder as they usually are, and unusually it&#8217;s dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate &#8211; it&#8217;s just a shame that we&#8217;re only going to get 4 or 5 cups out of the 125g can. Yummmmm!
