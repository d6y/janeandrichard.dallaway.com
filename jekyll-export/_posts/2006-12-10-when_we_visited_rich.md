When we visited Rich&#8217;s folks in Margate in July we discovered that [our neice&#8217;s other half](http://www.dontstayin.com/members/djmatisse-fontaine) had a talent for dj-ing. This visit we discovered that he&#8217;d started doing the clubs. Last night he was dj-ing at the [Funk me Good Sunglasses Party](http://www.dontstayin.com/uk/margate/punch-judy/2006/dec/09/event-88821). We didn&#8217;t think he needed his Aunt and Uncle in Law (nearly) turning up, but it all went off a storm!
