I popped into [Sussex Stationers](http://www.ciao.co.uk/Sussex_Stationers_Shop__5113262&e=10313) at lunchtime and spotted [The Rough Guide to the Da Vinci Code: History, Legends, Locations](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1843535173/richarddallaway). An interesting concept that one. A book about the facts behind a [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552149519/richarddallaway). There also seems to be an accompanying book for another of the [Dan Brown](http://www.danbrown.com/) books [Angels and Demons](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552150738/richarddallaway) of [Illuminating Angels and Demons: The Unauthorized Guide to the Facts behind the Fiction](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1843171317/richarddallaway). 

On a related note, I also noticed that there is an [Angels and Demons tour](http://www.nerone.cc/romemtm/nuovosito/newtours/angelsdemons.htm) in Rome, and a [Da Vinci Code tour of Paris](http://www.viator.com/brochure/product_show.jsp?ID=1010&PRODUCTID=1016&CODE=3588DAVINCI) and Fodor have A [DIY Da Vinci Code Tour: London](http://www.fodors.com/wire/archives/000905.cfm).

A lot of people seem to be cashing in on the Dan Brown thing.
