[Robbie Fowler](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/england/squad/newsid_1937000/1937815.stm), [Emile Heskey](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/england/squad/newsid_1939000/1939017.stm), [Michael Owen](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/england/squad/newsid_1901000/1901154.stm), [Teddy Sheringham](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/england/squad/newsid_1937000/1937885.stm), [Darius Vassell](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/england/squad/newsid_1937000/1937868.stm) 

For me, one of the bigger surprises is the inclusion of Teddy Sherringham &#8211; I didn&#8217;t expect him to make it this time, not at 36 years old. I&#8217;m also slightly surprised to see so many defenders named, but I&#8217;m sure this is a good thing. I&#8217;m pleased to see Owen Hargreaves included as he has impressed me the few times I&#8217;ve seen him play.

C&#8217;mon you England&#8230;.
