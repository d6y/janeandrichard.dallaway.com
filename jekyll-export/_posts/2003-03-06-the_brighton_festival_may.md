The [Brighton Festival](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk) (May 3 &#8211; May 25) programme dropped through our letter-box today. There&#8217;s nothing much that&#8217;s leaping out at me. Depressing. There&#8217;s &#8220;A Seaside Album&#8221; photo exhibition of pictures from 1840s to 1990s, which might be good. Lou Reed is down, which is probably something we should go and see. But apart from that&#8230;well, maybe if I read the text a little more I&#8217;ll find some good stuff.

There&#8217;s also the [Brighton Festival Fringe](http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/) and [Brighton Fringe Festival](http://fringe.brighton.co.uk/), neither of which I&#8217;ve looked at in any detail yet.

In related news, this year we&#8217;re going to help out with the web site for the [Virtual Festival](http://www.virtualfestival.org.uk/). More on that another time, because I think I&#8217;ve gone over my allowance for the word &#8220;Festival&#8221; today.
