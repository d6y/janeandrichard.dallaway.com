I finally finished the [Lord of the Rings](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0261103253/richarddallaway) trilogy on Friday. Finally. After many, many months. Its a really great book and I really enjoyed it, but I think its the kind of book that works best if you can dedicate good reading time to it.
