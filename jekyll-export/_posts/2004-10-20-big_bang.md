Last night we went to the [Brighton](http://www.cafesci-brighton.org.uk/) [Cafe Scientifique](http://www.cafescientifique.org/) at [Terraces Bar and Grill](http://www.the-terraces.co.uk/). [Simon Singh](http://www.simonsingh.net/) was the guest speaker, all about the [Big Bang](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007152515/richarddallaway). Despite there being a lot of people there, and the acoustics/lack of microphone making it hard to hear at times it was a very good talk, explaining the facts and theories in a really accessible manner &#8211; the way I wish I&#8217;d been taught science at school (rather than my physics teacher at senior school announcing that &#8220;as far as I&#8217;m concerned women are only here to give pleasure to me and give birth to my children and I don&#8217;t see why I should teach them physics&#8221;).
