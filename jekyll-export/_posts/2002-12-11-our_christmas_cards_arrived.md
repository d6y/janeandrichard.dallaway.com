Our Christmas cards arrived from [CharityCards.co.uk](http://www.charitycards.co.uk) arrived today, so we can now get on with writing them. It seems like we&#8217;ve only just finished writing Thank You cards for all our very generous friends after the [wedding](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedding/). Maybe we should have gone for the [Personalised Christmas Cards](http://www.charitycards.co.uk/top.php?id=146) so we didn&#8217;t have to write anything &#8211; somehow though at the time that seemed just too impersonal, now I&#8217;m beginning to think it would have been a great idea!
