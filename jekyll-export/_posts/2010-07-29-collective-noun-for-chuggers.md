> what&#8217;s the collective noun for chuggers? There are 4 of them huddled around a lamp-post at the Bond Street/North Street junction

I got quite a few replies, some via twitter and some via facebook.

Helen suggested:

> A pillage of chuggers? An infestation of chuggers? A coven of chuggers?

Relly [offered](http://twitter.com/RellyAB/status/19820127693):

> A campaign of chuggers? A smarm of chuggers? A knifetwist of chuggers?

Simon [came up with](http://twitter.com/harriyott/status/19820360851):

> A I-must-tell-you-I-get-paid-for-doing-this-but-its-still-a-good-cause of chuggers?

> I would say an irritation of chuggers ðŸ™‚

> that&#8217;s an &#8220;ambush of chuggers&#8221;

was the one I [declared](http://twitter.com/JaneFoth/status/19824248156) to be my favourite
