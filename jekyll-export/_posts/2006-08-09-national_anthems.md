The [US Navy Band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Navy_Band) have made MP3s sort of available for quite a few [national anthems](http://www.navyband.navy.mil/anthems/all_countries.htm). It&#8217;d be super if they were available under a [creative commons license](http://creativecommons.org/), rather than this one: &#8220;The music files on this website are intended for official use by Department of Defense and U.S. government offices only. Exceptions to this policy will be considered on a case-by-case basis&#8221;. 

And some of [these bugle calls](http://www.navyband.navy.mil/anthems/bugle_calls.htm) would make cheesy ring tones.
