Well, we&#8217;re back in Brighton now after an action packed week in Ireland. I haven&#8217;t had time to process the (many) photos yet, or write up the journal but it&#8217;ll happen sometime soon (ish!). We were on a cycling trip with [Irish Cycling Safaris](http://www.cyclingsafaris.com/) and we had a great time &#8211; the people on the trip were really good fun and we all got along really well. We did the [Connemara, Galway and Mayo](http://www.cyclingsafaris.com/tours/safaris/connemara.html) tour, and some of the scenery was beautiful. We were very lucky with the weather as we only had showers on 2 days, which is a bit of a miracle for the summer in Ireland this year which is shaping up to be [the worst for many years](http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/ireland/2002/0713/2630826566HM3WEATHER.html).
