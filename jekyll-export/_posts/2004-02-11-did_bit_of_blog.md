I did a bit of blog hopping this morning, starting from [nyclondon](http://www.nyclondon.com/blog/) and then heading to [LondonPhotos](http://www.londonphotos.org/) before spotting their section on [Polaroid Manipulation](http://www.londonphotos.org/archives/cat_polaroid_manipulation.html). It was interesting to read some of the [comments](http://www.londonphotos.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=23) especially the one from &#8220;o+&#8221; about how it was considered trite when he was at school. Strange how something that was once trite has become interesting because it&#8217;s now unusual.
