We&#8217;ve just got back from New England. Photos and report later, but for now I&#8217;d just like to make a nomination for Worst E-commerce Web Site Ever. The winner is&#8230; [Boston Duck Tours](http://www.ducktours.com). They give you lots of warnings about not using your back button. OK, fair enough, but when you do make a mistake you&#8217;re dumped to a page that has no links on it: you&#8217;re trapped, because you&#8217;re not allowed to use your back button. And the mistake I made? Not selecting a &#8220;state&#8221; when trying to order tickets from the UK (there&#8217;s no &#8220;outside US&#8221; option in the list of US states). I couldn&#8217;t fake a US address because the address has to match the credit card number. So there I was, suck on a &#8220;you must enter a state&#8221; error page, after all ready entering my credit card number. Bah. And they charge you $2 extra for booking online. 

No, we didn&#8217;t take their tour. Yes, I&#8217;ve told them about their web site, but they didn&#8217;t bother to reply. 

Sorry&#8230; I&#8217;ll try not to rant in future. Must think calm, happy thoughts.
