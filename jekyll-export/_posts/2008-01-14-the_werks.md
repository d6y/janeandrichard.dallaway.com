Today is my third day, or part day, working out of [The Werks](http://werkshop.org.uk/). 

I&#8217;m used to spending most of my week working in my own space, to shouting down the phone as loud as I like, laughing out-loud in video chats, playing music, or having complete silence&#8230; all that stuff. So why am I trying out a more open space? 

The short answer is, I don&#8217;t know. The longer answer is that I have a hunch that there&#8217;s something special about a bunch of people in a room. [Serendipity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Princes_of_Serendip) is the word I&#8217;m looking for and it&#8217;s a good match to The Werks: &#8220;Werkshop is a new concept which aims to provide a supportive environment for new ideas.&#8221; 

So it&#8217;s going to take me a while to adjust, which is why I&#8217;m determined to make the effort to get down to The Werks as regularly as I can in January. Only then will I be in a position to judge the merits of being out there&#8230;. although, in part, it depends on who else shows up. 

In terms of facilities, I can&#8217;t see anything missing: internet, electricity, lighting, desks, chairs, coffee, water, doors, windows, cycle parking&#8230; it&#8217;s all there, it&#8217;s been thought about, it all works, it&#8217;s all good. It&#8217;s not the centre of Brighton, but [actually](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hove) the location is great. 

It&#8217;s exactly the kind of space a few of us have been talking about for a while, so I&#8217;m delighted it exists and is working so well.

Each Friday in January is open to anyone. I thought [the first one](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/399483) worked out really well: I certainly enjoyed it. Look for [the event on Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/venue/99520/) and try it out.<br clear="all" />
