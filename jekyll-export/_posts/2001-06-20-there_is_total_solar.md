There is a total solar eclipse tomorrow in Southern Africa and Madagascar. The BBC claim to be doing a [live webcast](http://www0.bbc.co.uk/science/space/eclipse/africa_eclipse2001.shtml) of it so that will be how I watch this one. The Maximum moment is at 14:11 (British time). At the time of the last total solar eclipse in August 1999 I was with Richard and our friends Paul and Tess at [Lake Balaton, Hungary](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/hungary.html) to watch it. It was a fantastic experience, and I would still love to go and see another one. It was a totally awesome sight to watch the sun disappear, and it was easy to see why ancient cultures saw it as a prophesy of doom.
