If you&#8217;re having a party and wondering how much soft drink to get in, here&#8217;s a graph summarizing the proportions of consumption we saw at our little do the other day. It&#8217;s more-or-less in-line with the
  
moderately interesting Britvic soft drink report 2006 ([PDF](http://www.britvic.com/NR/rdonlyres/etmjpjzvaoyddt5jcgctwcty2omr3tuan6jgcrcu6pbpa3b7fzdhoqwky56umm5fp5vx7nyhkftxwj/SDCRfinal.pdf), which contains wonderful phrases such as: &#8220;Consumption occasions are the key to understanding and targeting consumers, to ultimately unlock category expansion&#8221;).

Of course more beer was glugged than all soft drinks combined.
