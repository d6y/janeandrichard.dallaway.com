We went to see [Sussex v Hampshire](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/shared/fds/hi/statistics/cricket/scorecards/2004/7/6852/html/scorecard.stm) at Twenty20 cricket on Friday evening. I&#8217;d expected a far higher scoring game, and at 6 for 3 I was wondering whether I should change allegiance to become a Hampshire Hawks supporter. It was my first cricket match, and it was quite enjoyable (although I didn&#8217;t get the hang of all the [Twenty20 rules](http://sport.guardian.co.uk/cricket/story/0,10069,976281,00.html)). I was very impressed with how family oriented the whole occasion was, with children playing ball games before the match and a good, friendly atmosphere with home and away supporters mixed together.

The beer was good, but the sausage and chips was a total rip off.
