So, we lost 2-1 on aggregate. I wish I could say we were hard done too but, in all honesty I can&#8217;t. We played poorly in the first half &#8211; we seemed to be playing far too defensively. We looked a lot better in the second half and created a couple of good chances. Orient were the better team but I think they are going to be hard pushed to beat Blackpool in the final at Cardiff.

The atmosphere wasn&#8217;t as good as I&#8217;d hoped &#8211; we were on the terraces and had no roof to help magnify our sound. Shame. I have little voice left so I know I did my bit. The Orient only seemed to have one song &#8220;Orient, Orient&#8221; &#8211; a bit like the Skol lager song. At least we had some variety to offer &#8211; including singing &#8220;One song, you&#8217;ve only got one song&#8221;.

It&#8217;s dissapointing to lose out but when I think back to how close we were to losing the club completely I don&#8217;t feel quite so bad. Next season let&#8217;s do it properly and get automatic promotion.

And so, instead of heading for Cardiff on the 26th, it looks like we&#8217;ll be on shed building duty &#8211; helping Rich&#8217;s Dad. Somehow this doesn&#8217;t have quite the same appeal.
