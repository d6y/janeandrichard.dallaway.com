A weekend of food related stuff. Firstly, on Friday evening we revisited the [Noir Caribbean](http://www.noircaribbean.com/menu.asp) takeaway, this time trying the goat curry and chicken curry which we both polished off in no time, all washed down with a bottle of [local organic wine](http://www.englishorganicwine.co.uk/).

On Saturday we pottered around the [A Taste of Sussex](http://www.brightonfoodfestival.co.uk/brighton_festival_food_market_2006.php) market, picking up some [local food](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2742/), drinking some [local beer](http://www.thebeerstation.co.uk/) and generally chilling out enjoying the sunshine. We headed out to Hove for dinner, but with no real plans, and decided on [Los Amigos](http://www.theinsight.co.uk/eatingout_dec.htm#losamigos) for dinner, which was good, but as with our last visit, the bill seemed surprisingly high. Our last stop for the day was [The Sussex](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/31/3137/Sussex/Hove) for beers.

Today, Richard had to head off to London, so I decided to continue the food based weekend and, [armed with my camera](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/), I visited a few local food shops, both [tried](http://www.montezumas.co.uk/) and [tested](http://www.infinityfoods.co.uk/infinity-retail/index.html) and [new to me](http://www.sussexandthecity.co.uk/), before returning to the [food festival](http://www.brightonfoodfestival.co.uk/), to sample some of the [hot](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2728/) [food](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2751/) and also to watch a few of the shows on the [live](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2753/) [food](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2752/) [show](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/tasteofsussex/img_2736/) stage. Then home to cook some [bagels](http://www.fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipet.cgi?r=14003).
