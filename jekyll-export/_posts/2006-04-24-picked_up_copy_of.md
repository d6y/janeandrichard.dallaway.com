I picked up a copy of the &#8220;[Brighton Festival of Artists Open Houses](http://www.aoh.org.uk/2006/)&#8221; booklet at the weekend. When browsing through it I spotted that [Jules](http://www.anagramworks.co.uk/) has got some work being exhibited &#8211; at [Holland Street](http://www.aoh.org.uk/2006/Hanover%20Art%20Trail/listings/176_Holland%20Street/) and [Art Organic](http://www.aoh.org.uk/2006/Beyond%20the%20Level/listings/56_Art%20Organic/).
