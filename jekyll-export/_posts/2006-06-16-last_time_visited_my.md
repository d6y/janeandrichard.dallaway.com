Last time I [visited my parents](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/05/filey) we headed back from Filey via Bridlington, and happened to stumble across the [Bayle Gate](http://www.bridlington.net/business/bayle/Index2.html). My Grandfather was a stonemason by trade, and Dad told me that the Bayle Gate was one of many buildings he&#8217;d played a small part in preserving. I wish I knew other things he&#8217;d worked on, or what his [mason&#8217;s mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason's_mark) was.
