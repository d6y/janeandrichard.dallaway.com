A few months ago we became aware of the interesting idea of the [Squash on the Beach](http://www.squashonthebeach.com/) event. It was due to start last weekend with a 50 hour charity event, and then move on to a tournament. On a couple of occasions over the weekend, and yesterday evening, we went hunting for the &#8220;glass court&#8221; but all to no avail, not a glimpse of it. Today, I&#8217;ve taken a look at the website and have discovered that it has been [postponed](http://www.squashonthebeach.com/news.php?newsid=35) until next August &#8211; due to &#8220;a failure by a third party contractor&#8221; when it will be held in a [specially commisioned air-conditioned dome](http://www.squashonthebeach.com/showimage.php?img=30_07_dome.jpg).
