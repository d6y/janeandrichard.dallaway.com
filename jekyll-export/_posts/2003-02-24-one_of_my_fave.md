One of my fave pictures of all time: [the earth at night](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0011/earthlights2_dmsp_big.jpg) (big; there&#8217;s a [smaller version](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0011/earthlights_dmsp.jpg)). The picture was created by joining up photos from satellites, according to the [NASA write up](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap001127.html).
