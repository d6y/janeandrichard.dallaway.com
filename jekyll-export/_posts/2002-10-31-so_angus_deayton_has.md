So, Angus Deayton has been [sacked](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2373711.stm) from &#8220;[Have I got News For You](http://www.hignfy.net/)&#8220;. Mind you, Jeremy pointed out that on Friday, HIGNFY is against the first episode of &#8220;[The Osbournes](http://www.mtv.co.uk/mtv.co.uk/en/dynamo/the_osbournes/microsite.htm)&#8220;. So&#8230; is it a ploy to make sure the BBC get lots of viewers?
