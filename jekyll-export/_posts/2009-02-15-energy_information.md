[Jono](http://twitter.com/jonoabroad) and then [Graeme](http://nodestone.com/people/grasuth/) pointed me at Google&#8217;s [energy information](http://www.google.org/powermeter/smarterpower.html) project, which looks very much like something I&#8217;d be interested in. 

Specifically I was wondering if it was possible to take the data from something like [Wattson](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/10/wattson) and using some heuristics or some kind of Fourier analysis to detect what appliances were consuming electricity. And better still, compare that against what&#8217;s possible and, perhaps in some cases, suggest it&#8217;s time to dump that highly inefficient model of refrigerator and replace it with a new one ðŸ™‚ 

But anyway&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what Google are doing, but take a look at the graphs they want to produce. They looks useful to me. 

Graeme also pointed me at [HomeCamp](http://homecamp.pbwiki.com/): it&#8217;s a hack day/unconference, around the theme of energy monitoring.
