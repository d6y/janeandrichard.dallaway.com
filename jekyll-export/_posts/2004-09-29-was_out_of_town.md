I was [out of town](http://www.sourceo2.com/Events/2004+Annual+Event/default.htm) yesterday, so I don&#8217;t have any first-hand experience of the [pro-hunt demo outside the Labour conference](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3695786.stm). I&#8217;ve been catching up on the whole dead horse thing via various blogs: [Jamie](http://jamie.message.uk.com/blog.php?id=104&offset=0), [Iestyn](http://iestyn.net/mainBlog/archives/000087.php), [Tom&#8217;s Blog of a nobody](http://hplovejet.blogspot.com/), [Adactio](http://adactio.com/journal/display.php/20040928220735.xml), [their side of the story](http://www.countryside-alliance.com/content/view/535/146/) and more importantly the Sky News report: [Hunt supporters strip](http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-13229707,00.html).
