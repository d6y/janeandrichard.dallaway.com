Since coming back from [Canada](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/Canada2004) we&#8217;ve bought a few 

snowboarding magazines and books to tide us over and help us find a great resort for next 

year. We bought the World Snowboard </p> 

guide 2004</a> which has a useful looking [accompanying site](http://www.worldsnowboardguide.com/) and seems pretty detailed 

but the spelling mistakes let it down somewhat, also a copy of [Snowboard UK](http://www.sukmag.com/) and a copy of [Onboard](http://www.onboardmag.com/). We&#8217;ve also ordered a year&#8217;s subscription to 

the [Snowboard Journal](http://www.thesnowboardjournal.com/) on Luke&#8217;s </p> 

recommendation</a> but the shipping to the UK is sloooow (6 &#8211; 8 weeks) and so we haven&#8217;t 

received our first issue yet.
