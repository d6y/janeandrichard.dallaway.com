The guy on the left (without the beard) is my grand nephew, Reece. The main [post office](http://www.royalmail.com/stamps/smilers_for_you/christmas.asp?strHead=christmas_range&strSubHead=none&strSection=christmas_range&strPageFile=christmas_range/christmas_range.htm&strtemplate=christmas) in
  
[Canterbury](http://www.hillside.co.uk/tour/tour.html) has one of those photo booths which allows
  
you to get your face on a book of stamps. So Reece did, and the
  
above is a scan is off the envelope from the Christmas
  
card he sent to us. 

I think he looks worryingly like [Calvin](http://www.ucomics.com/calvinandhobbes/characters.htm) (from [Calvin & Hobbes](http://www.ucomics.com/calvinandhobbes/)).
