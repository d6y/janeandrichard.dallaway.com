I finished reading [Life on Air](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0563487801/richarddallaway) by [David Attenborough](http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/who/david_attenborough.shtml) over the weekend. I don&#8217;t read many autobiographies but I really enjoyed this one &#8211; it&#8217;s really well written, and full of facts about the places, animals and people he&#8217;s spent time with. Thanks to [Ash and Mit&#x171;l](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/neelastewedding/190_9042_r1/) for recommending and then buying it for us.
