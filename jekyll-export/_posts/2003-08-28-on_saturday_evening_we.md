On Saturday evening, we helped Simes celebrate his birthday by going along to one of the [Music for a Summer Evening](http://www.picnicconcerts.com/start/default.asp) events at Kenwood House. We saw [Bjorn Again](http://www.bjornagain.com/), and I have to say they were great. I&#8217;d never been sure about the whole tribute band thing, but thought it might be fun, and it was. Daisy, now 18 months old, appears to be a bit of a rock chick, and seemed to particularly enjoy herself.
