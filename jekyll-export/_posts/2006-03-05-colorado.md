**Colorado 2005**

A snowboarding trip in Colorado, 10 nights spent at the lovely [Four Peaks Inn](http://www.fourpeaksinn.com/) in [Breckenridge](http://breckenridge.snow.com/) staying in the [Gold Nugget room](http://www.fourpeaksinn.com/our_rooms.html). Breckenridge was a great place to base ourselves, with loads of bars and restaurants to chose from. I&#8217;d return to Colorado, and to Breckenridge and would definitely spent time on Breckenridge mountain, at A-basin and at Keystone.
