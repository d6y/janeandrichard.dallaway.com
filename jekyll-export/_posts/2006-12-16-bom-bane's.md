We caught up with some friends the other evening at [Bom-Bane&#8217;s](http://www.bom-banes.co.uk/) cafe in Kemp Town. Emma had spotted a review of it in [The Kemptown Rag](http://kemptownrag.co.uk/) and the [Argus review](http://www.theargus.co.uk/whatson/fooddrink/bombanes/) made it sound so intriguing we just had to try it. We had the 27 chimes table, and had the Christmas set menu &#8211; smoked salmon blinis for starters, then beef wellington and finishing with either Christmas pudding or Christmas waffles. They have a great Belgian beer collection &#8211; the Blanche de Bruxelles was great, but the Mort Subite was just too sour for me. A great evening catching up with friends in a really unusual but lovely cafe.
