Apparently ITV have an answer to [mini Motty](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/05/mini_motty), you can also download [Desktop Des](http://www.itv-worldcup.co.uk/static/desk_top_des/index.html), a mini Des Lynam to sit on your desktop. Desktop Des appears to be sponsored by [Tic Tac](http://shakeyourtictacs.co.uk/) and doesn&#8217;t do as many interesting things as Motty, but even Motty is quite delayed with his goal reports unfortunately 🙁 I think I&#8217;ll stick with Motty as well as the radio/tv coverage.
