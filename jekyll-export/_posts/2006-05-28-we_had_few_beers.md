We had a few beers at the [Windmill](http://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/pubs_gallery_windmill.htm) with friends on Friday evening. Whilst there Kirsty and I both had massages from [Urban Chill](http://www.urban-chill.com/). I&#8217;d never heard of these people, or seen them before, but looking on their website it seems that they visit quite a few bars (mostly in London). There is no fixed price for a massage, you just pay what you think it was worth. A nice service, and a great treat for a Friday evening.
