A few weeks ago we took our first snowboarding lessons at the Snowdome. Great fun, but a lot harder than it looks. I&#8217;ve scribbled a few notes on the experience in [a report at igloolife.com](http://www.igloolife.com/travel/article.php?ArticleID=15).

The same weekend we spent near Chesterfield, on the edge of the Peak District, and we took some [photos](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/snowdome2002/).&#8221;
