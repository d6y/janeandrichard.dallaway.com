Last night we went to the [Komedia](http://www.komedia.co.uk/) to see [Stewart Lee](http://www.stewartlee.co.uk/main.html). He was very good, despite having been to the [funeral](http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/6416) of [Malcolm Hardee](http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/mhardee.html) yesterday. He finished his normal act, took a break and came back to finish with a recital of some prose he wrote for the [Sit-down Comedy: Stand-ups Swap the Stage for the Page](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0091889243/richarddallaway) book, edited by Malcom Hardee.
