I took the following photograph with the eyemodule last night, but what is it of? Is it a photo taken from a rocket as it approaches a planet surface? Is it a knee?

&#8221;

So, do you think you know what it is? If so, then [email me](mailto:jane@janeandrichard.co.uk?Subject=Photoquiz) with your suggestion.

**Guesses so far &#8211; Update 27 March 2001**

There have been a few guesses so far:

  * a pint of guiness
  * a pint of beer
  * a street lamp
  * a bald head

None of them is quite right so far&#8230; altho one is quite close. So, any other [suggestions](mailto:jane@janeandrichard.co.uk?Subject=Photoquiz)?
