When we were at my folks house at the weekend I collected a couple of old cameras to play with. One is a [Baldawerk Baldixette](http://www.geocities.com/jgpyke/baldixette.htm) and the other is a [Coronet Conway Popular Box Camera](http://www.ozcamera.com/photo 9/902.jpg). I&#8217;ve tracked down some reasonably priced film from [7dayshop](http://www.7dayshop.com/catalog/default.php) and so I guess I&#8217;ll be experimenting with film and digital over summer.
