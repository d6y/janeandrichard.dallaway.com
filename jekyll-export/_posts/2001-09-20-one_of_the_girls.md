One of the girls in our office had a really bad attack of the hiccups this afternoon, so much so that all of the office resorted to trying to find a way to make her stop. The usual suggestions were made &#8220;Hold your breath&#8221;, &#8220;Drink water slowly&#8221; etc. but the one that worked was a new one on me. Julia walked up to her with a ten pound note in her hand and said &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you this if you hiccup again&#8221;. She didn&#8217;t. It was quite amazing really.
