In last Wednesday&#8217;s FT, there was a short article I liked: &#8220;&#8230;stereotypes such as &#8220;anoraks&#8221;, nerds or geeks [&#8230;] are inaccurate. Corporate techies tend to be much graver in disposition. There are parallels with catering in that the more prestigious the restaurant, the ruder the waiter. Generally speaking, that is how it appears with senior techies.&#8221; 

&#8220;Their apparently lack of social skill is not (always) related to arrogance or shyness, it is more to do with the fact that they get paid to make very far reaching decisions and so their responses tend to be very considered and bereft of small talk. Try asking a technical architect if they would like a coffee. The delay in their response is generally proportional to the seriousness of the consideration they are giving your questions and not a sign of contempt.&#8221; 

&#8220;They are blessed with a job that is truly creative. [&#8230;] If you want a senior techie with both business and technical skills be braced to pay royally. Such people are rare, but have the power to truly align your IT investment with the needs of your organization. So it&#8217;s worth coughing up.&#8221; 

&#8220;They [techies] are attracted by problems because their game is solutions. [&#8230;] With senior techies you are advised to show off your difficulties. A nice touch would be to suggest that your problems are unsolvable.&#8221;
