I was planning to blog lots while I was in San Francisco, but [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) doesn&#8217;t work very well on Netscape running on Sun hardware. So if I can remember anything, I&#8217;m going to try to blog a few things over the next few days.

I flew with [Virgin Atlantic](http://www.virgin-atlantic.com), which was OK. Good selection of films on the flight, oh-so-tempting option to make phone calls, and a selection of early 90s games to play. Shame my game controller didn&#8217;t work on the flight out or the flight back.

Caught up on some movies on the flights: [Antitrust](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0212346) (fun, glad I didn&#8217;t bother seeing it at the cinema), [Miss Congeniality](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0212346) (ditto) and Disney&#8217;s [Tarzan](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120855) (excellent). In San Fran I saw [Shrek](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0126029), which you should go and see if you like [Toy Story](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0126029)-style movies.

I also got to see a film called [Extreme](http://www.imax.com/films/distribution/extreme.html) in the IMAX. Being towed out to surf 20-60 foot waves&#8230; snow boarders with a death wish&#8230; climbing frozen waterfalls with no ropes. Mmmm.
