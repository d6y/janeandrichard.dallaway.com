[Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/) were selling two models of HP Ipaq at a ridiculously low price this morning (the Ipaq H1910 was selling for &#163;7.32 and the Ipaq H5450 was selling for &#163;23.04). The story has been picked up by the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2864461.stm) and by [The Register](http://theregister.co.uk/content/54/29820.html). I ordered one of each, and received my confirmation email. The history of other such mistakes doesn&#8217;t make it likely that they&#8217;ll honour it. Shame üôÅ
