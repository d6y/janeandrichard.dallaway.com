During our [weekend visit to Hull](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/easter2007/) to see my folks, we took a day trip to Skegness and up the coast past [Anderby Creek](http://www.anderbycreek.co.uk/) (which was beautiful) and up to Mablethorpe. In Skegness I spotted this Walk-thru McDonalds &#8211; looks like it was originally built as a drive thru.
