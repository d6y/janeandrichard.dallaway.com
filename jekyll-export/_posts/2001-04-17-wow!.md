Wow! One of our web servers needed rebooting at the hosting place we use, and people had been trying to get out of doing it all afternoon, it&#8217;s normally such a hassle to go over there and do it. Then Jon (one of our Director&#8217;s) said we could take his car. So, we did. We took his Lotus 340r out for a spin to the hosting site, Tricky got to drive it, and I got to be the passenger saying &#8220;Wow&#8221; a lot. Cool car, really cool, impractical for London (no roof, no doors &#8211; those kind of things) but definitely well cool. He bought it around this time last year, and guess what, he has a [website](http://www.lotus340r.co.uk) dedicated to it. There were 340 of them made, and his is number 157. Wow!
