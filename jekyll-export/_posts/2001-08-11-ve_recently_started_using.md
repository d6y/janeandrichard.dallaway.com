I&#8217;ve recently started using [Intellisync for yahoo](http://calendar.yahoo.com/?v=140&pi=100) to synchronise my palm to my yahoo calendar, address book and todo list, and so far it&#8217;s working really well. It means that when I do a hotsync from my Palm rather than synchonising with the palm desktop, it syncs with the yahoo software making my calendar etc available to me over the internet. What I especially like is the fact that I can choose which applications to sync with yahoo, so at the moment I have the calendar and to do list synchronising all the time that way. The Memos and Addresses I sync with the Palm desktop (at the moment) as they are more likely to be changed from home rather than on the fly. So far everything is going smoothly, and I&#8217;ve even got it working from work &#8211; so that my Outlook account exports calendar and synchronises task list data to yahoo (I&#8217;m only exporting calendar data rather than synching it because I don&#8217;t really want everyone at work to know what my social calendar is like&#8230;). This means that for finally I have my personal appointments and my work appointments all on the palm, but without having to type the work ones in.

This is of particular use at the moment as I haven&#8217;t found a new PDA yet and so am using a PalmPilot Professional. To be honest, PalmOS doesn&#8217;t seem to have changed much in the 4 years since this was bought (which is a bit dissapointing) but I find that the grafitti recognition is now too slow to be practical on this old machine. So, being able to update events in my yahoo calendar is a much bigger advantage.
