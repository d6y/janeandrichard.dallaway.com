I [blogged about Geni](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2007/06/family_trees) a few months ago and had quite a few email conversations with the guys from [Geni](http://www.geni.com/tree) off the back of that blog.

Since then Richard&#8217;s family have really taken to Geni, and have added a couple of generations to their tree. They&#8217;ve found it really usable and seem to have enjoyed adding photos etc. Still no GEDCOM import yet for me though üôÅ

Today, a box of goodies arrived from Geni for me, thanks Geni!<br clear="all" />&#8220;
