Well, most presents are bought, and most cards are written. The food shopping is being ordered tonight, so we&#8217;re almost ready! I finish at work on Thursday evening, and am off until the 2nd January so get a lovely long time off.

It was the company Christmas meal, at the [Middle House in Mayfield](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/main.jhtml?xml=/travel/2000/01/22/ethote22.xml), on Friday evening, which was really pleasant &#8211; quite sensible (i.e. not on a sinking boat like Aspect&#8217;s Christmas party of 1999!!!), good food, lots of booze (although I was driving) and a good mixture of people.
