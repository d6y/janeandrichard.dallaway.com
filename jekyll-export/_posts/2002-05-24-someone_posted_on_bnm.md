Someone posted on [BNM](http://www.brightonnewmedia.org) this morning about the new O&#8217;Reilly book &#8220;Essential Blogging&#8221;. This is due for release in August, but is currently available for [technical review in PDF form](http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1440). It&#8217;s aimed an novice bloggers and people who don&#8217;t have a blog at the moment and want one, and reviews the different options. I&#8217;ve had a read of the first chapter, and it seems to be pretty well written, and very readable.
