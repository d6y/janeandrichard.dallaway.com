Mandy and Chris visited us over the weekend and took us out of town to the Yew Tree Inn (&#8220;Nr Polegate, Sussex, 01323 870590&#8221;). It&#8217;s a pub that serves top food&#8230; too much top food, but I couldn&#8217;t stop myself eating it. Aside from food they also serve [my current favourite beer](http://www.briansbelly.com/beerbelly/caffreysirishale.shtml). The tables are maybe a bit too close together, but apart from that, it gets both (yes, both) thumbs up.

Of course, we&#8217;ll never find it again as it&#8217;s in the [middle of nowhere](http://www.multimap.co.uk/map/browse.cgi?client=print&X=550000&Y=110000&gride=554432&gridn=107427&scale=200000&coordsys=gb&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=BN266RX&place=).
