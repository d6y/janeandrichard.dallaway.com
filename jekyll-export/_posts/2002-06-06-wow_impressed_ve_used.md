Wow, I&#8217;m impressed. I&#8217;ve used the [pixology](http://www.pixology.com) service quite a few times now to get digital photos produced on photographic paper and the service has always been pretty good. I send a set through on Tuesday (passport photos as well as some other snaps) and the photos arrived through the post this morning. Such a fast turnaround is so impressive. Unfortunately, my passport photos are too dark so I&#8217;m going to have to lighten them up before I send them off again.
