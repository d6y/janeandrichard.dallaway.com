I spotted [TiVo&#8217;s Data Collection and Privacy Practices](http://www.privacyfoundation.org/privacywatch/report.asp?id=62&action=0) linked from another blog ([BoingBoing.net](http://boingboing.net)) and it makes kind of interesting reading. I&#8217;m not sure whether I&#8217;m surprised by this or not, I guess I knew Tivo was capable of this as the capturing of viewing data is what makes Tivo work. The paragraph &#8220;TiVo permits its subscribers to disable the collection of viewing information and diagnostic logs by calling TiVo toll-free at 1-877-367-8486 (1-877-FOR-TIVO).&#8221; is kind of interesting though.

On further investigation, CNN ran a story on the subject yesterday [Privacy group criticizes TiVo for collecting info](http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/03/26/tv.privacy.ap/index.html)
