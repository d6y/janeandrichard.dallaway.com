I didn&#8217;t find [Kwak](http://www.bottledbeer.co.uk/?beerid=997) (8%) beer to be &#8220;very smooth and spritzy&#8221;. Although I do like the taste of strong Belgium beer, such as the Chimay (scary at 12%), this one had an initial taste of neat spirit. Not something I look for in a beer. But that&#8217;s me: [Paul](http://www.paulbooth.com/) liked it, and with a great comedy name, it had to be tried.
