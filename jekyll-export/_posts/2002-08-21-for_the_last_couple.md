For the last couple of days there has been a [Mini Moke](http://www.mokeclub.org/) in the garage over the road from the office. This afternoon a couple and their kids came to collect it, and we were having a good nosey at it to see what it drove like. As they pulled out Jeremy recognised the guy &#8211; it was [Nick Berry](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Berry,+Nick+(I)). So that&#8217;s my second famous Brightonian. Lots more to go&#8230;
