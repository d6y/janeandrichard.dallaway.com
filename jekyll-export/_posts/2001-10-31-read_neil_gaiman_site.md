I read [Neil Gaiman&#8217;s site](http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/journal.asp) this morning and learnt that [Josh Kirby](http://www.abandonart.co.uk/artists/biog_jk.html) has died at the age of 72. He was the illustrator who designed the covers of all the Terry Pratchett [Discworld books](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dbooks-uk%26field-keywords%3Dterry%20pratchett%20discworld%26bq%3D1/ref%3Dsr%5Faps%5Fallb%5F1%5F4/202-4152271-4498238/richarddallaway/202-4152271-4498238). I can&#8217;t imagine Pratchett books without Kirby illustrations, they just won&#8217;t be the same.
