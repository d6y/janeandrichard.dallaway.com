Yesterday we were in a packed house at the Pavilion Theatre to listen to [Heather Couper](http://www.hencoup.com/Heather.htm) and [Nigel Henbest](http://www.hencoup.com/Nigel.htm) talk about [The Red Planet](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/index.asp?id=551).

The talk was a kind of summary of their book, [
  
Mars: The Inside Story of the Red Planet](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747235430/richarddallaway), and it was entertaining and interesting, as I&#8217;m sure the book is. Three things stood out: 1. Heather Couper&#8217;s praise of Brighton, and the North Laine in particular, as cool place and a cross of San Francisco and Sydney; 2. Heather&#8217;s feelings for why people need to go to Mars (lots of emotions there); 3. They believe [life has already been found on Mars](http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/07/20/viking.anniversary/). 

Regarding life, the interesting question becomes: is the life on Earth and Mars based on the same kind of carbon? If it is, then maybe there&#8217;s a common origin. But if it&#8217;s not, then life developed independently so maybe there&#8217;s life everywhere out there.
