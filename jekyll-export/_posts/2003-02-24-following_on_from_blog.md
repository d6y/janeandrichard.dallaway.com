Following on from a [blog almost a year ago](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/04/spam_scam), Wired News are running an [article](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,57760,00.html) on how a man was murdered in Nigeria&#8217;s consul in the Czech Republic by a guy who was conned out of his money as part of one of the Nigerian bank scams. It seems he&#8217;d be cheated out of his money, and had been visiting the Consul regularly for a year trying to recover the money he had lost.
