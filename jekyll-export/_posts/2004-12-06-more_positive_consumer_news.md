More positive consumer news&#8230; a while ago we switched from our [Audi A3](http://images.google.com/images?q=audi%20a3) petrol automatic to a manual [Honda Civic](http://images.google.com/images?q=honda+civic) diesel. (Why? 33mpg to 55mpg, amongst other reason). The [Yeomans Honda in Bognor Regis](http://www.yeomanshonda.co.uk) were great, did us a fine deal. Recommended. 

At the time we were told the servicing was every 12,000 miles. Turns out from the log book, it&#8217;s every 9,000 miles. Ouch. Called Yeomans, even though it was a word of mouth difference, the sales guy, Drew, said yes he remembers saying that, and appologized: it&#8217;s 12,000 on petrol, which is where the confusion came it. We figure over the life time of the car we&#8217;d end up doing one extra service, so Yeomans put everything right by giving us a free service to make up the difference. So&#8230; Yeomans are recommended further for fixing the problem, and they&#8217;re top of our list next time we go looking to change vehicle.
