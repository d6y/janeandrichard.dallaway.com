We&#8217;ve been watching the [UEFA Cup Final](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/football/uefa_cup/newsid_1973000/1973191.stm) this evening between Feyenoord and Borussia Dortmund. It&#8217;s been one of the dirtiest and cheaty matches I&#8217;ve seen for ages &#8211; players diving all over the place, a Dortmund player sent off after 32 minutes, 2 penalties &#8211; one to each team. And to cap it all there is a hoarding that says &#8220;Fair Play&#8221;, yeah right.
