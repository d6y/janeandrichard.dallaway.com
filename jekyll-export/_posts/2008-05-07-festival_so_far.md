It&#8217;s [festival time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Festival), and although we&#8217;re not doing much in the [Brighton Festival](http://www.brightonfestival.org/) itself, we have a punishing schedule in the [Brighton Festival Fringe](http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/)&#8212;which, [I&#8217;m told](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Festival_Fringe), is the &#8220;England&#8217;s largest arts event, and the 2008 Fringe is the second largest Fringe Festival in the world&#8221;. Citation needed, indeed.

So far we&#8217;ve been to&#8230;

  * [X-Files Improv](http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/comedy/listing.asp?ev=1440&ed=8903) with Dean Haglund, who turns out to be the [long haired blond geeky one](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0353750/) in the X-Files. A small turn out (30 people?), but a huge amount of fun. Essentially, an X-Files episode is created using audience suggestions, and it worked really well. A top act. 
  * We spent an hour or so of a boiling hot day in [The Last South: Pursuit of the Pole](http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/listing.asp?ev=1431&ed=8900). Yes, there were initial technical issues with the sound, and yes the venue suffered from being on a roundabout on bank holiday Monday with motorcycles roaring passed, but this didn&#8217;t distract from a great play. It was Scott and Amundsen on stage, writing their journals, in step with each other, but with very different experiences. Touching, funny, etc. 
  * Up to the university we dropped in on a [professorial lecture](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/alumni/pages/prof_lectures/theodora_duka.html), namely &#8220;[Alcohol: a simple molecule with complex consequences for emotion and behaviour](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/473258/)&#8220;. We learned about the experiments on memory and behaviour under the effects of booze, and it was eye-opening. I didn&#8217;t know, for example, that drinking enhances your memory (but only for events before the drinking starts). Naturally, there was a wine reception after. 
  * And tonight we went to see [Mike Leigh in conversation with Amy Raphael](http://www.brightonfestival.org/Event_Details.aspx?eid=2754), discussing his films and watching bits of some of them. We headed back home to sign up to [LoveFilm](http://www.lovefilm.com) to get his back catalog. 

One negative: the &#163;1 per ticket booking fees are evil, especially as the booking system isn&#8217;t finished and the web sites are frustrating to use. And on top of that &#8220;internet booking fees&#8221; should be made illegal. But, there&#8217;s no competition, so we pay. I&#8217;d rather have to pay than not have it at all, is what it [comes down to](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)).
