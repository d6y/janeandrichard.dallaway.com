I&#8217;ve just seen an article on [TheBoarder](http://www.theboarder.co.uk/) about a [charity](http://www.dianfossey.org/events/sking_information.html) event happening at [Castleford Xscape](http://www.xscape.co.uk/castleford/Default.asp?f=1) snow dome in June. It involves dressing up in a gorilla costume and snowboarding/skiing with the intention of completing 100 miles in an hour between all the participants. The snowboarding bit doesn&#8217;t seem so bad, but managing to get on the poma lift dressed as a gorilla sounds hard. Good luck to all those who take part.
