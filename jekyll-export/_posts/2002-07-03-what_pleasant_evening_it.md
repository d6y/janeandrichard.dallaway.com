What a pleasant evening. It&#8217;s Jeremy&#8217;s birthday today so we&#8217;ve just been to the Three Jolly Butchers for a couple of pints with the birthday boy. It&#8217;s a really nice pub, and is in danger of becoming our &#8220;local&#8221; &#8211; fairly quiet, serves good beer, not too busy (sounds like we&#8217;re getting old doesn&#8217;t it??? &#8211; ho hum).

For Jeremy&#8217;s birthday we bought him the [Executive Air Hockey Game](http://www.thediscoverystore.co.uk/index.asp?product=30925) from the [Discovery store](http://www.thediscoverystore.co.uk). Somehow, I think this will be arriving in the office tomorrow, actually, make that I ***hope*** this will be arriving in the office tomorrow :-D. Apologies to anyone in the Three Jolly Butchers this evening who wondered what the hell the noise was &#8211; that was us. Sorry!
