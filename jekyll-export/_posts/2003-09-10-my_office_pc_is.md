My office pc is running XP Professional, and one thing has been driving me mad &#8211; MSN Messenger version 4.7 insists on running and then telling me that it isn&#8217;t a secure version. Finally, today I found a [knowledge base article](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=302089) explaining how to turn it off. Yay!
