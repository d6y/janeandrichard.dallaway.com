After going to [Camera Club](http://www.bhcc-online.co.uk/) last night and seeing some of the photos people have produced using home printers rather than the dark room or the printing services from people like [pixology](http://www.pixology.com/consumers/consumerinformationfr.asp) I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s time to look into getting one myself. My first stop is the [Canon website where you can upload an image](http://www.yourprint.canon-europe.com/index.html), and they&#8217;ll print it out on the printer you&#8217;re interested in. I&#8217;ve chosen [this image](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_02_09/148_4823/) as I seem to recall that images with greens in can be tricky to produce.
