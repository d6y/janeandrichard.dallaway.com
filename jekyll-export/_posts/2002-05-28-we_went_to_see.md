We went to see [Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0121765) last night. This is a much darker story than [The Phantom Menace](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120915) and despite what the first trailer implied, it&#8217;s not all a love story. Phew! I was dissapointed that the annoying Jar Jar Binks is still alive and wasn&#8217;t killed off but he doesn&#8217;t have much screen time and I guess I should be grateful for small mercies. Natalie Portman (as Senator Amidala) takes on an almost Lara Croft role with cropped tops and guns, and Yoda, with the help of CGI, walks. It kept me amused and entertained but it doesn&#8217;t feel &#8220;complete&#8221;, which I guess it isn&#8217;t, whilst you are watching it you know that this is a passage to get us to where we were at the start of the original Star Wars films.

Will we go and see the third one? Of course. We&#8217;ve invested too much time and effort into the [Star Wars](http://www.starwars.com/) films to not go and complete the story. Will we buy this one on DVD? Well, only if the original series gets relaunched and we need it to make up the set.
