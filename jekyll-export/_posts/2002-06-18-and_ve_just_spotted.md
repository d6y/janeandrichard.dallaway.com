And I&#8217;ve just spotted [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/worldcup/get_involved/riochants.shtml), a page dedicated to chants about Rio Ferdinand, to the tune of Duran Duran&#8217;s Rio. My current favourite is &#8220;His name is Rio and he plays for Engerland, Oh Rio, Rio take us to the promised land.&#8221;
