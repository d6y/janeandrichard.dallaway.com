The council have [put up a site](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1164145) to calculate the time and cost of walking, cycling, driving or catching the bus around the city. [JourneyOn.co.uk](http://www.journeyon.co.uk) seems to do a pretty reasonable job, even though it couldn&#8217;t find a walking route for a walk I do fairly regularly. Looks like it could be handy.
