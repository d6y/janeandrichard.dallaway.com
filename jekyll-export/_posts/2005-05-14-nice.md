**Nice 2005**

We took Lorraine away for a weekend in [Nice](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/europe/nice/index.htm). We travelled with [EUJet](http://www.eujet.com/EN/) from [Manston airport, Kent](http://www.kia-m.com/index.asp) and flew directly to [Nice airport](http://www.nice.aeroport.fr/include/default.asp?l=2), a 20 minute bus ride from the centre of Nice.

We took a walk towards the Fruit and Flower market and had a lovely wander around before it started to rain and we took this as an opportunity to grab some lunch. We headed to the [hotel Solara](http://www.venere.com/hotel/index.php?htid=16084&) and checked in. We headed off towards the [Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art](http://www.mamac-nice.org/english/) and walked around the outside, but as it was only an hour before closing we decided to head off to the beachfront for a couple of beers in the sunshine.

On Sunday we headed off along the Promenade des Anglais to the Port and admired the huge boats before catching a bus to Cimiez and having a wander through the beautiful Franciscan Monestary gardens before heading back towards the airport and back to Kent.

Nice was a great place for the weekend, lots to do and see and I think it is safe to say that we all enjoyed it.
