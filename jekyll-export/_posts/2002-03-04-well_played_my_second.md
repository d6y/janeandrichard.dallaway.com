Well, I played my second game of squash tonight &#8211; Susie is teaching me how to play. Unfortunately, whilst we were warming up the ball I managed to pull a muscle so I played the whole time with a bit of a limp (much to Susie&#8217;s amusement). I obviously didn&#8217;t do enough [stretching](http://www.scottishsport.co.uk/squash/DaveHeath/DaveHeathSaysStretch.htm) but I will next time.
