It looks like there will be a [parade around London for the Olympic athletes](http://www.olympics.org.uk/press/pressdetail.asp?boa_press_id=383) &#8211; it&#8217;ll be held on Monday 18th October. Other details aren&#8217;t known yet, but the [BBC mention](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/3652118.stm) that _it will end in Trafalgar Square, with highlights of the Games being shown on big screens._
