I&#8217;ve just been having a look at some technology news on yahoo, and spotted [this article](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=73&ncid=738&e=7&u=/zd/20020524/tc_zd/5108178) about six people being arrested on suspicion of being involved in the [Nigerian email banking fraud](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/04/spam_scam). It seems like they&#8217;d been managed to rake in hundreds of millions of US dollars during their time of operation.
