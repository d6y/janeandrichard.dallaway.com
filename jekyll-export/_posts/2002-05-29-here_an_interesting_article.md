Here&#8217;s an interesting article on how lucky we are to be alive:
  
[Amid the Universe&#8217;s Chaos, a Few Habitable Places](http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/goldilocks_zone_020528-1.html) (spotted on [Slashdot](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/05/28/1534224&mode=nested&tid=160)). It&#8217;s a look at how dangerous the universe is, and how small the window for life is. The conclusion: life (as we know it) may be harder to find that we thought. The other side of the coin is that we should probably make plans to get off this planet. With that in mind, there&#8217;s some good news &#8212; it&#8217;s not [Star Gate: SG1](http://www.stargate-sg1.com/home/faq/index.html#1) yet, but I&#8217;m told that [quantum wormholes could carry people](http://www.newscientist.com/news/print.jsp?id=ns99992312).
