Well, I watched the eclipse on the BBC site. It has to be said that a live web feed isn&#8217;t quite the same as being there, especially when the camera ran out of battery power, but it was still a pretty impressive sight and I&#8217;m glad I watched it. The BBC have already put some pictures up on their [news site](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1400000/1400738.stm) and I&#8217;m sure more will appear very soon. Watching the eclipse brought back some great memories of our trip to [Hungary](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/hungary.html) for the last one, and made me think about trying to see another one sometime.
