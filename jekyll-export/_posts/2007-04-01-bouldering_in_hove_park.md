Since [Jim broke his wrist](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157600018308647/), I haven&#8217;t been to the [climbing wall](http://www.evolutionindoorclimbing.co.uk/evolution.htm), and I&#8217;ve missed it. A couple of weeks ago I stumbled across information that there is a [boulder park in Hove Park](http://education.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1141162), and so today we went for a cycle ride to take a look.

It is about 3 metres high and probably about 12 metres long with areas ranging from scramble, to slight overhangs. We spent half an hour there climbing, traversing and doing the odd scramble. I am really impressed to have something like this so close, and available for free. I&#8217;m hoping to start visiting on a weekly basis to have a play.<br clear="all" />
