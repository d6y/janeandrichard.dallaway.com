Grrrr&#8230;. I&#8217;ve been using the search facility on my (newly xp&#8217;d) pc a lot this morning, desperately trying to find a function in one of my source files. I knew it was there, as the code works, but I couldn&#8217;t find it. I was using the &#8220;A word of phrase in the file&#8221; search and it was bringing back no results. So, I [google](http://www.google.com)d it and found [this](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q309173). Apparently source code files aren&#8217;t very &#8220;relevant&#8221; and so those helpful people at M$ have removed them from the search so as not to &#8220;pollute&#8221; the results. Thanks for that then!
