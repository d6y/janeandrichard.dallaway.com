That was an odd weekend. On Friday I found myself back in Cambridge for the shutdown party of a Logica office I worked at some ten years ago. I was there for a couple of years, doing some funky things, with some lovely people. It&#8217;s somewhat voyeuristic going back, but it was good to catch up with everyone.

And on Sunday I was back at Blackfriars for the [Hatters](http://www.hatters.org.uk/) AGM. This took me across the road from the ugly [Kings Reach Tower](http://www.ipcmedia.com/findus/howtofindus.php), where I worked, on and off, for four years. All in all, a weekend of my brain resurfacing lots of subconscious associations with places.
