We watched &#8220;[Sliding Doors](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120148)&#8221; last night &#8211; [Tivo](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml) had recorded it for us at Christmas, and we hadn&#8217;t got around to watching it (we&#8217;d seen it at the cinema years ago). As the ending credits ran I was really surprised to hear a Dido track on it, and I&#8217;d wondered if this had been added to the film later, but a quick scan on [imdb soundtracks](http://us.imdb.com/Soundtracks?0120148) seems to say it was original. It&#8217;s strange how Dido didn&#8217;t seem to become well known here until 2 or so years later.
