Ever since going to [Calcutta](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/india2004/index.html), I&#8217;ve been experimenting with Indian cookery. I recently bought [An Indian Housewife&#8217;s Recipe Book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0716020785/richarddallaway) which has some great, and simple, recipes in it &#8211; current favourites are fresh spinach curry and also beef kebabs (which I use as burgers on the bbq). My only other Indian cook book is [Indian Cooking Class](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1863960562/richarddallaway) which again has some tried and tested recipes in it. Today, Richard sent me a link to [BBC &#8211; Food &#8211; Recipes &#8211; Indian essentials](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/mostof_indianessentials1.shtml) which seems to have some good background information, as well as links to some more interesting looking recipes to try one day.
