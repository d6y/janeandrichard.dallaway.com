I&#8217;m going to have to stop posting photos of the [Brighton Bears](http://www.brightonbears.com/) until I get a zoom on the [camera phone](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/p800.xml)&#8230;you can&#8217;t see anything really. But we were at a game with [Nigel & Cheryl](http://www.nigelgordijk.co.uk), I had the phone with me, so I took photos. [Brighton won](http://www.brightonbears.com/fixtures/fixture_details.asp?fix_id=87), which is the main thing ðŸ™‚
