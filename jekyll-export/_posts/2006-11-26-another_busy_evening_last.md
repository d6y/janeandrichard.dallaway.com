Another busy evening last Tuesday, with both a [Cafe Scientifique](http://www.cafescientifique.org/brighton.htm) and a [Sussex Geek Dinner](http://sussex.geekdinner.co.uk/) to go to. We headed off to Cafe Sci and listened to [Jim Skea](http://www.psi.org.uk/people/person.asp?person_id=31) of the [UK Energy Research Centre](http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/) talking about UK energy policy &#8211; what&#8217;s science got to do with it? We stayed for the talk, but moved on before the questions and answers as unfortunately this talk was very similar to one we&#8217;d heard earlier in the year. 

The [Sussex Geek Dinner](http://sussex.geekdinner.co.uk/?p=9) was held in the Black Horse again, and despite a slight mix up with the food (new owners, insufficient details on Simon&#8217;s booking) the venue was good. [Simon](http://www.harriyott.com/) hosted well, despite his sniffles and a good crowd showed up. It was good to catch up with some [familiar](http://www.andybudd.com/) [faces](http://web-tart.co.uk/), as well as to meet some [new](http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/) [ones](http://www.builtbydave.co.uk/). As long as Simon keeps organising them in Brighton, I&#8217;ll probably keep turning up. 

Now to get on and organise a [Brighton Bloggers](http://www.brightonbloggers.com/) meetup for January&#8230;
