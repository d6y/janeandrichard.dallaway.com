Whilst we were in Hull at the weekend, Mum and Dad were telling us the unfortunate tale of an elderly friend. It seems that this lady had had her handbag stolen from inside her house twice within 2 weeks. The first time, they&#8217;d broken the back door to get in. She was inside but didn&#8217;t see or hear anything &#8211; just found a broken door and no handbag. The second time, she came downstairs to find a man in her kitchen, she asked him what he was doing in her house and he left, with the handbag. No sign has been found of either of the bags, or the people. But how scary must that be, to find a man in your kitchen. She was very lucky that he just ran off, and didn&#8217;t decide to add battery to his crimes. \*Shudder\*
