I was having a browse around [iPod Hacks](http://www.ipodhacks.com/) over lunch and spotted a couple of Shuffle protectors &#8211; the [Griffin iVault](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/ivault/index.php) (a bit hard core for me) and [Wrappers](http://wrappers.typepad.com/) (my favourite is [sunflower](http://wrappers.typepad.com/wrappers/2005/04/sunflower.html)). Currently I don&#8217;t have a cover for my [shuffle](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodshuffle/), although we do have an [eVo iSkin](http://www.iskin.com/evo.html) for our main [iPod](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipod/).
