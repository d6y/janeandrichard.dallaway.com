I accepted a job offer today. I&#8217;m going to be working for a small company in Portslade doing internet/intranet stuff and I start on the 7th of January. Hurrah!

Unfortunately, the news isn&#8217;t as good for most of the other guys that I was made redundant with. There don&#8217;t seem to be many jobs around at the moment, and there seem to be agencies listing jobs that don&#8217;t exist, or agencies that won&#8217;t give you more details about a job before you send them your cv &#8211; all a bit suspicious.

For the record, here is a list of the job sites I&#8217;ve been using, ranked with the best at the top:

  * [jobserve](http://www.it.jobserve.com/Jobserve/Homepage.asp) &#8211; always has a lot on offer (not all of them exist though)
  * [gojobsite](http://www.gojobsite.co.uk/index.html) &#8211; again has a lot on offer, and there isn&#8217;t much cross over with jobserve
  * [wired sussex](http://www.wiredsussex.com/nmd/JobSearchLatest.asp) &#8211; doesn&#8217;t have much on offer, but it is all local (to me anyways)
  * [monster](http://www.monster.co.uk/) &#8211; allows you to create an online cv so potential employers can find out more about you
  * [planetrecruit](http://www.planetrecruit.com/channel/int/index.cgi) &#8211; not a bad site, but seems to have many of the same jobs as gojobsite, and I prefer the gojobsite layout
