What do we want? [Monorail!](http://www.area51newmexico.com/simpsons/simpsons_monorail.html) But in fact the Brighton (Area?) Rapid Transport system will probably be a funky looking New Zealand built electric bus, judging by the pictures at the [council web site](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1146307). Should be good for anyone wanting to get into town without sitting in [traffic](http://www.citytransport.org.uk/emerge.html), but I&#8217;m not sure of the [status of the proposal](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4526366.stm) at the moment. 

Anyone looking for rat runs through town could turn to page 24 of the original proposal ([PDF](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/downloads/bhcc/transport/rapid_transport_report.pdf)), where you&#8217;ll find a map of the areas of peak congestion:
