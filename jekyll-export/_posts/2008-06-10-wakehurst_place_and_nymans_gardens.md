Last weekend we headed off to [Wakehurst Place](http://www.kew.org/places/wakehurst/index.html), a botanic garden and conservation area managed by the [Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew](http://www.kew.org/). Wakehurst Place was added to my to-visit list earlier this year when it was mentioned at a [Cafe Scientifique](http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/) talk about [The Flower Hunters](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/208221/). It wasn&#8217;t the sunniest day, but it was warm and dry and we spent a [good few hours walking around the gardens](http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/workoutdetail/index.do?id=215662). We didn&#8217;t manage to get around all of it, and in fact missed almost all of the [Woodland zone](http://www.kew.org/places/wakehurst/zone_woodland.html) &#8211; a good reason to return.

I really enjoyed the [Conservation zone](http://www.kew.org/places/wakehurst/zone_conservation.html) and walking along the raised walkway above the water. At the end of the day, and after reading a few leaflets, and finding out that we&#8217;d get our admission fee back, we decided to join the [National Trust](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-index.htm) for the year &#8211; we have a weekend in the Isle of Wight and a week in Cornwall later in the year and so hope we will be able to make a lot of use of it.

This weekend we took advantage of our new National Trust membership and visited [Nyman&#8217;s](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-nymansgarden2/) &#8211; the closest National Trust property to our house (I think!) and had a very pleasant afternoon. Nymans has gardens, woodland and amazing views over Sussex and it seems to be a really great space &#8211; people were picnicking, playing hide and seek, sitting on the plentiful benches reading the Sunday paper &#8211; a really, really welcoming area. We had a [short walk around](http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/workoutdetail/index.do?id=230651) and I&#8217;m looking forward to an opportunity to return and do some of the woodland walks and possibly even a visit to the house to take a look at the family rooms.
