We went to our last &#8220;planned&#8221; Festival event last night, it was [The Complete Lost Works of Samuel Beckett as found in an envelope (partially burned) in a dustbin in Paris labelled &#8216;never to be performed. Never. Ever. EVER! Or I&#8217;ll sue! I&#8217;LL SUE FROM THE GRAVE!!!&#8217;](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/index.asp?id=465) at Komedia. This was what I would class as Fringe theatre, although it was part of the main festival. I enjoyed it, but it wasn&#8217;t quite as polished as some of the other performances we&#8217;ve seen. That said there were some great bits in it, and it really is quite silly in places. I think starting it at 9.30pm was a great idea as it gave us chance to get some beers in before hand which I think helped&#8230; after all, they expect an element of audience participation!
