We seem to have a date for the next [Brighton Bloggers](http://www.brightonbloggers.com/) [meetup](http://www.brightonbloggers.com/meetup/). It&#8217;s going to be on Thursday 2nd October, at Riki Tiks, kicking off from 7pm. Check the [blog](http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blog/archives/2003_09_01_index.php#106434003042230383) for any updates, and probably a list of who is planning to be there.
