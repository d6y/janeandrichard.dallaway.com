On Tuesday evening Richard and I headed off to the Hotel du Vin for our first [Geek Wine thing](http://geekwinething.org.uk/) in quite some time. This one was the second of the new format Geek Wine Things, now being organised and orchestrated by Fergus De Wit and James Reina from [Majestic Wine](http://www.majestic.co.uk/).

There were 8 wines for tasting, 4 white and 4 red, made up of 4 classics and 4 bright young things.

It was a great evening, and as when in the [Hunter Valley](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/02/in-hunter-valley/) recently, I made a series of notes. These are made up of &#8220;wine facts&#8221; and tasting notes. Some of the more useful are:

  * The Spanish wine system is really focussed on the aging process &#8211; so Reserva and Gran Reserva have clearly defined meanings on a bottle of Spanish wine. This isn&#8217;t the case when these words are applied to many other nations wines
  * Good vintages for Rioja are 2001 and 2004
  * The younger a red wine, is the more breathing time it is likely to need
  * When thinking about wine and food matching, a good hint is to choose the kind of food that is served where the wine is made
  * If you buy a Spanish Reserva or Gran Reserva, then you&#8217;re probably on to a winner</ul>

Out of the white wines, my favourite was the first we tasted. This was [Albariño Martin Codax 2008 Rias Baixas](http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-albarino/product-is-14266). Albarino wasn&#8217;t a wine that I&#8217;d knowingly tasted before, and is indigenous to that particular area of Spain. It was described as being a good halfway house between Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay.

Out of the red wines, there were 2 that I really liked. These were [Emilio Moro 2006 Ribera del Duero](http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-ribiera/product-is-14437) and Muriel Gran Reserva 1996. The [Ribera del Duero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribera_del_Duero) is an up and coming wine area, and the Emilio was a lovely drink. The recommendation was to buy two bottles, drink one now and bury one in the bottom of your garden for 3 to 5 years to age further. Apparently [Robert Parker](http://www.erobertparker.com/) gave it a score of 92 &#8211; which marks it out as being a good buy. The Muriel is ready for drinking now and was a lovely smooth wine. As Richard said, if either of these were served to us we&#8217;d be delighted.

Apparently, Majestic are running a promotion on Spanish wines next month, so I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be heading down there to pick up some of these for our drinking pleasure.
