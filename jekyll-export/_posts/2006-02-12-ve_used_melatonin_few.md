I&#8217;ve used melatonin a few times, especially when flying between the UK and North America. I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s helped me re-adjust to UK time, but [new research](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/bmj.38731.532766.F6v1?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=melatonin&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1139785392171_14970&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&resourcetype=1) says I&#8217;m wrong.
