There I was in Tesco&#8217;s minding my own business when I stumbled across [The Sven-G&#xF6;ran Eriksson Classical Collection](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000063TTQ/richarddallaway) in their CD section. It&#8217;s a 3 disc collection of Sven&#8217;s favourite classical music &#8211; alegedly. I must admit that this is something I can&#8217;t really imagine many of the previous England managers doing!
