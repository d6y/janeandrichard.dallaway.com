We managed to attend two snowboard shows over the past couple of weeks &#8211; firstly, the [snowboard show](http://www.snowboardshow.co.uk/index.htm) at [Tamworth](http://www.snowdome.co.uk/) and then the [Sno!Show](http://whitelines.com/news/news/the-first-ski-and-snowboard-show-at-snozone-milton-keynes) at [Milton Keynes](http://www.xscape.co.uk/snow/milton-keynes/whats-inside/snowslope/).

At the Snowboard show we attended a [talk on photography by Russ Shea](http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2007/10/russ-shea.html) before having our first ever rails lesson with Hamish McNight and Stu Edwards. We caught up with [Ash](http://www.snowboardcoach.co.uk/ashnewnesprofile.htm) and collected a couple of demo boards he&#8217;d brought down for Richard to try, whilst I made the most of the exhibitors and took a [Salomon Ivy](http://www.salomonsnowboard.com/us/products/IVY-1-788748.html) and a [Burton Feelgood](http://www.snowboard-asylum.com/cgi-bin/psProdDet.cgi/800931||feelgood~@c~@b|0|user|1,0,0,1|3|) out for a spin. The Ivy was much twitchier than I&#8217;m used to and is a lot more of a handful than [the one I tried in Breckenridge](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/03/whilst_we_were_snowboarding) a few years ago, but that could be because it has become more of a freestyle board in the intervening seasons. The Feelgood was lovely, a really enjoyable ride.

The Sno!Show seemed busier, and had taken over a lot of the snow area of Xscape catering to both skiers and snowboarders. Again I took out a couple of different boards, firstly the [omatic](http://www.omaticsnowboards.com/shp.html) [super by Tara Dakides](http://www.snowboard-asylum.com/cgi-bin/psProdDet.cgi/800958||@cSnowboards@bO-Matic|0|user|1,0,0,1|6|) and then the [Head Fountain](http://www.ridehead.com/#women_boards/1282). I didn&#8217;t find the omatic board very interesting and defnitely not as much fun as my [Ride Kashmir](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/06/ride_kashmir_151). The Head Fountain however I loved &#8211; it was really responsive and I spent most of the time riding this with a great big smile on my face.

When I bought my Ride Kashmir 18 months ago I bought it because it was the best board of the 2 I&#8217;d been able to hire whilst in Breckenridge. These demo days make so much sense as I&#8217;m a firm believer that, at least for me, it isn&#8217;t the graphics that matter, it&#8217;s the ride style. I tried 2 boards that I wouldn&#8217;t have ever dreamt of trying, and one, the Head Fountain, turned out to be a really fun board to ride and one that I&#8217;m looking for a good reason to buy to add to the collection :-D. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be making the effort to attend this kind of day again to try out more new shiny things&#8230;
