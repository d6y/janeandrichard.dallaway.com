We found this picture yesterday in the art centre of [Syon House](http://www.guidetorichmond.co.uk/syon.html) and Richard bought it and a frame for me as part of my birthday present. I hadn&#8217;t seen any of Jack Vettriano&#8217;s work before, and this picture really appealed to me. I was surprised to find out he is Scottish, as this picture really makes me think of the USA, probably because I associate the style of dress with gangsters. &#8220;The Billy Boys&#8221; is on display at [Portland Gallery](http://www.portlandgallery.com/) in London, and I feel that I may need to go and see the picture in the flesh (so to speak).
