During my journey yesterday I finished reading [The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and Getting Advice Successfully](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0932633013/richarddallaway) which is a really well written book. I&#8217;m normally not very good at reading these serious, work related books, but I found this to be pretty good. Lots of good advice, and lots of humour.
