Our friend Karl (guy in the middle of [this photo](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/surprise/img_1701_640/)) is going to run the London Marathon in April this year. He&#8217;s running in aid of the [British Lung Foundation](http://www.lunguk.org/) and is trying to raise &#163;1,500, so if that&#8217;s a cause you want to support then sponsor him [here](http://www.justgiving.com/karlhoods/).
