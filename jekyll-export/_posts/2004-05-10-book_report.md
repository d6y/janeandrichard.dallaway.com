I&#8217;ve just finished reading [another](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2004/02/finished_reading_life_on) couple of autobiographies. The first was [&#8220;Pretty good for a girl&#8221; by Tina Basich](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060532203/richarddallaway) and the second was [&#8220;It&#8217;s not about the bike : My journey back to life&#8221; by Lance Armstrong](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0224060872/richarddallaway).

Both are about sporting personalities, [Tina Basich](http://expn.go.com/athletes/bios/n/BASICH_TINA.html) is a snowboarder who was one of the pioneers of female snowboarding and successful too having won many events including the Big Air competition at the 1998 Winter X Games, [Lance Armstrong](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) is a very successful cyclist having won the Tour de France 5 times despite (or maybe because of) fighting through a major illness.

Both were well written, both had poignant moments, both of them are inspiring. I might add [&#8220;Every Second Counts&#8221; by Lance Armstrong](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0224064738/richarddallaway) to my [wish list](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/wishlist/EQ852DWZQO11/ref=wl_em_to).
