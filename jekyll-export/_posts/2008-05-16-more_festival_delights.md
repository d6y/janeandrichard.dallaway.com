It is still Festival time, and as [Richard mentioned the other day](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/05/festival_so_far), we&#8217;ve made a real effort to see some of the many fringe shows:

  * [Open Wide](http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/comedy/listing.asp?ev=1231&ed=9258) &#8211; A comedy sketch show with 2 actors covering topics from Justin Timberlake appearing on a history program, to Hitler being investigated by Columbo and the Sweeney. Not the funniest show I&#8217;ve ever seen but had some good sketches
  * [Final Cut: Lightning Documentary Challenge](http://www.finalcut.gb.com/archive_11_05_08.html) &#8211; showing short films (2 minutes each) produced by teams in 24 hours covering one of the fringe acts appearing on Saturday. Some great films and even better an opportunity to catch some more fringe acts &#8211; the [Pet Sounds v Sgt Pepper](http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/listing.asp?ev=1626&ed=10350) show looked good, and we even had live music from [The Top Bananas](http://thetopbananas.net/) whilst the judging was going on. Some of the films are [now available on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/BrightonFinalCut)
  * [Catchy! The Great plague musical](http://www.totalbeast.co.uk/catchy.html) &#8211; A cross between a Carry On film and a pantomime. Smutty, funny and with some great tunes to hum along to. And a bargain at &#163;8 for a good 2 hours worth of entertainment. I&#8217;m still not sure if the guy sitting next to me sneezing during a musical about the plague was a good sign though.

The festival continues for another 10 days or so and we&#8217;ve got a [couple](http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/comedy/listing.asp?ev=1617&ed=10152) [more](http://www.sherlock-holmes.org.uk/event_info.php?id=120) shows to attend.
