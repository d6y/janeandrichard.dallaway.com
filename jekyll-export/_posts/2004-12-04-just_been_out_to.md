Just been out to do a bit more Christmas shopping and stumbled into [SheActive](http://www.sheactive.co.uk/), a women only sports shop that recently opened in [Brighton](http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=530996&y=104259&z=1&sv=530996,104259&st=4&mapp=newmap.srf&searchp=newsearch.srf&dn=516). This strikes me as a great idea as normally when looking for [cycling gear](http://www.sheactive.co.uk/sport.html?cart=110217369271873234&group=2&type=sport) I struggle to find many women&#8217;s options in local stores, and end up ordering from [Ground Effect](http://www.groundeffect.co.nz/) in New Zealand (great kit, just a long way away). I managed to come away only having bought a [bag](http://www.sheactive.co.uk/item_detail.html?itemno=586&group=9&type=sport&cart=110217387171882115) this time, but I&#8217;ll be back next time I need some new kit.
