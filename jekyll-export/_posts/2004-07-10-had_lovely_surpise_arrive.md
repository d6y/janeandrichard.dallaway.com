I had a lovely surpise arrive in the post this morning. My copy of Muriel Spark&#8217;s _All the Poems_ arrived. It&#8217;s the [hardback](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/185754773X/richarddallaway) version, published by [Carcanet Press](http://www.carcanet.co.uk/) and it has [one of my pictures](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/summerfireworks/img_0449_640/) on the front of it, and a credit on the back. There is also a [softback](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811215768/richarddallaway) version published by [W W Norton](http://www.wwnorton.com/) in the US.
