We&#8217;re just back from 2 weeks in Canada snowboarding in 4 [British Columbia resorts](http://skibc.com/) ([Fernie](http://www.skifernie.com/), [Kimberley](http://www.skikimberley.com/kimberley_alpine/), [Panorama](http://www.panoramaresort.com/index.htm) and a bonus day trip to [Kicking Horse](http://www.kickinghorseresort.com/winter/)). Unfortunately, whilst the UK has been having [lots of snow](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4318657.stm) (including just about enough to [snowboard on in Ashdown Forest](http://www.snowblogs.net/node/23)) most of the resorts we were at were desperately in need of the white stuff. Fortunately the bases were pretty good, and the grooming guys were working hard to make the best of it. We had a great time, and I can only imagine how good Fernie and Panorama must be when there is powder about.
