Last Sunday we headed out to the [Ridgeview wine estate](http://www.ridgeview.co.uk/) near Ditchling to see what tastings they were doing to celebrate [English Wine Week](http://www.english-wine-week.com/). Ridgeview specialise in sparkling wines, so the best comparison from last years vineyard visits was our visit to [Nyetimber](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2005/05/to_celebrate_english_wine). The major difference is that Ridgeview is open to the public 6 days a week for tastings throughout the year, something we may take advantage of next time we have visitors. We tasted the [Grosvenor](http://www.ridgeview.co.uk/htmls/som%20memoir%20grosvenor%2001.htm), the [Cavendish](http://www.ridgeview.co.uk/htmls/som%20memoir%20cavendish%2003.htm), the [Fitzrovia](http://www.ridgeview.co.uk/htmls/somfitzrovia03.htm) and their special, limited red, the Pimlico, and left with 4 bottles to enjoy over summer.
