We were in the new look Sainsbury&#8217;s in West Hove yesterday, browsing along the cereal aisle, and then we spotted it &#8211; &#8220;Adult Cereals&#8221;. This isn&#8217;t really a term I&#8217;ve ever come across before, I&#8217;d considered Cereals as a whole category, or maybe with sub-categories, such as muesli or cornflakes or whatever. So, does this mean that to differentiate the regular, every-day kind of cereal they need to be rebranded as [adult cereal](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4331/is_199010/ai_n15117912)?

For the interested, the cereal offered in &#8220;Adult Cereals&#8221; were things like Fruit and Fibre and All Bran. Definitely NOT more interesting than frosties, cocoa pops or rice crispies.<br clear="all" />
