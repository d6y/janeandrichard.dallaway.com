Many thanks to [Andy](http://andybudd.com/) for telling us about [Waves](http://www.theargus.co.uk/whatson/fooddrink/waves/) in Hove. They are a Dosa Diner, and carry dosas as well as idli, pooris and other indian &#8220;street food&#8221;.

We headed out there this evening and gave them a try, and we&#8217;ll be back having had a most satisfying eat on dhai poori, masala dosa for me and a spring dosa for Richard. All washed down with a glass of red for Richard, and a couple of sweet lassis for me.<br clear="all" />
