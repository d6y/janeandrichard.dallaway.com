I&#8217;m still reading [Neil Gaiman&#8217;s blog](http://www.americangods.com/journal/journal.asp) every day and on Tuesday he talked about Fay Weldon and her new book &#8220;The Bulgari Connection&#8221; which is sponsored by Bulgari, and contains &#8220;product placements&#8221; (the first time this has been done in a novel apparently). Neil comments on it, giving a bit of a background on it before going on to say:

_Personally, I think it&#8217;s a triffic idea, and would like to announce that any manufacturers of fine fountain pens who want to get plugged in the text of the next novel should just drop me a line. And a sample fountain pen or two. Also people selling small south sea islands &#8212; I will happily plug your south sea island sales company in my next novel in exchange for a small island of my own._

Well, it made me chuckle anyway.
