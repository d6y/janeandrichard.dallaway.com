The [Zvon Character Search](http://www.zvon.org/other/charSearch/PHP/search.php) is one of those really useful geek sites that I can never remember the name of, or the address of. Okay, so it&#8217;s not going to be of interest to many people, but if you ever code xml it might just be of use as it gives the codes for entitys.

Hopefully now I&#8217;ll have a good way to track it down everytime I need it ðŸ˜€
