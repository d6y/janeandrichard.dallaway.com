Last night, at the [Half Moon](http://www.halfmoon.co.uk/) pub in Putney, a friend&#8217;s band took to the stage: headlining for the first time. They&#8217;re called [Hostess](http://www.hostessmusic.com).

What sort of music? &#8220;Hostess combine glorious trip hop beats with delicate melodies to refresh your soul.&#8221; You can listen at <http://www.hostessmusic.com/music.html>.
