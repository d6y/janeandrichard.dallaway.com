I was just about to write a blog post about our week in Les Arcs last week, when I realised we&#8217;d never blogged about last years [Big Trip](/tag/bigtrip08/). So here it is, better late than never. I&#8217;ve created 5 blog posts, one for each of the 5 different states we visited as this blog post was getting way too long, so follow the links in the list below to find out more about each state.

Last February Richard and I headed off on an adventure, a month in the US/Canada, mainly based at or near snowboarding/ski resorts. We decided to fly as far West as we needed to, and head back inland over the course of a month. We&#8217;d [started planning](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2007/08/more_snowboarding_news) by buying a map of the US, and attaching post-it notes to the cities with [airports](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/Airports_of_the_NW.kmz), and working out where we could get to by plane. We sat down and consulted the internet, and copies of the [World Snowboard Guide](http://www.amazon.co.uk/World-Snowboard-Guide-Steve-Dowle/dp/0954801423/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231595787&sr=1-1) and [Ski Snowboard America](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ski-Snowboard-America-2009-Canada/dp/0915009889) to find a shortlist of resorts to aim for and then started plugging together a month&#8217;s worth of flights, car hire and accommodation.

The states we visited over that month were: 

  * [Oregon](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/01/big_trip_08_oregon)
  * [British Columbia](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/01/big_trip_08_british_columbia)
  * [Idaho](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/01/big_trip_08_idaho)
  * [Montana](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/01/big_trip_08_montana)
  * [Wyoming](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/01/big_trip_08_wyoming)

There are a whole heap of [GPS traces](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/) from our various snow days, and by my reckoning (with a bit of help from my [Nokia 6110 Navigator](http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4366035) and [Sportstracker](http://sportstracker.nokia.com)) we covered 506.09 miles on lifts and boards over 21 days on the slopes at 11 different resorts. We also ended up with a lot of [photos](http://flickr.com/photos/janed/collections/72157604236171483/) and a [couple](http://d6y.blip.tv/#789998) of [videos](http://d6y.blip.tv/#789988).

A great, great time, and something I&#8217;d love to repeat when I&#8217;ve saved up some more pennies.
