A recent, recurrent theme, seems to have been me mentioning that I don&#8217;t run much any more. After all, I have a dog to walk and she likes to play with other dogs etc. Well, that&#8217;s all fine in principle, except, well, I&#8217;ve been talked into doing the [Brighton Santa Dash](http://www.santadash.com/pages/brighton) again. So, Saturday &#8211; that&#8217;s the 12th December &#8211; will find me queueing up with a collection of other Dashing Santas and running 5k along the seafront.

There are a collection of other Madgex Santas running, and Alex has kindly set up a [Just Giving donation page](http://www.justgiving.com/BrightonSantaDashers) to collect our generous friends contributions. So, go on, head on over, pop a couple of quid into the coffers.

Last year I managed a time of 33:03, this time as I&#8217;ve done a lot less training I expect to be slower. On the plus side, the weather forecast is looking more favourable ðŸ™‚
