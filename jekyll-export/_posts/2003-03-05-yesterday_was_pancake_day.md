Yesterday was Pancake day, and in a change from tradition we didn&#8217;t have a [pancake party](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/pancakes2002/) at our house. Instead we took our &#8220;mobile pancake solution&#8221; (batter, maple syrup, lemon juice, sugar, chocolate and bananas) around to [Paul](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/henstagday/img_2436_640/) and [Tess](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedding/photos/Unofficial/gaf_cd1_024_21/)&#8216;s house and made pancakes there instead. James (2 years) wasn&#8217;t too impressed by the whole idea, preferring to play with his trains instead. Whilst baby Max (4 weeks) slept, fed and vomited his way through the proceedings.

Top pancake filling of the evening was Madagascan vanilla ice cream, with maple syrup and grated chocolate. Or at least it was for the none-Atkins-diet people &#8211; Paul had his own special pancake mix which made the most yellow pancakes I&#8217;ve ever seen and had his own special fillings although he was spotted stealing some of the ice cream ðŸ™‚
