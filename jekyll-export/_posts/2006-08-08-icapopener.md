Richard sent me the link to [Mobuzz from August 4th](http://www.mobuzz.com/shows/3048.html) and told me to watch the section on the [iCapOpener](http://www.popgadget.net/2006/08/icapopener.php) &#8211; a new add-on &#8211; a bottle opener for the [iPod Shuffle](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/shuffle.xml). There&#8217;s some video oh how to work it at [Andalux](http://www.andalux.com/icapopener/). What a cool idea, we&#8217;ve often said that mobile phones should come with bottle openers, so I guess this is the next best thing ðŸ™‚
