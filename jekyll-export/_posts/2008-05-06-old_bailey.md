Transcripts from the Old Bailey (from 1674 to 1913) are [now online](http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/), which has generated [plenty](http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11294471) [of](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/the_hitch/article843647.ece) [press](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/apr/27/law).

As I suspect many others have, I went searching for references to my family name and I&#8217;ve found a few&#8230;

  * In 1796, a 19 year old George Dallaway wandered into a warehouse and told the clerk that he wanted &#8220;half a hundred weight of sheathing nails&#8221;, but didn&#8217;t have the paperwork. The clerk gave him the goods, and thus a fraud was committed. Geroge was &#8220;respited to go for a sailor or soldier&#8221; which we take to mean he was given the opportunity to fight, but a few months later he&#8217;s in the proceedings as having a year in jail and a public whipping. 
  * Matthew Dallaway stole 12 spoons in 1769 and was transported. Nice touch in that he took them while the victim&#8217;s house was on fire. And he would have got away with it had it not been for the pesky pawnbroker grassing him up. His defense: &#8220;I was very much in liquor&#8221;, a phrase I plan to use whenever the situation merits it. 

It&#8217;s worth having a dig around the site for some of the [history to the publication](http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Publishinghistory.jsp). For example, the Proceedings were popular (&#8220;&#8230;in the opinion of many people one of the most diverting things a man can read in London&#8221;) until the rise of newspapers, and even carried [advertising](http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Advertising.jsp) for a while.
