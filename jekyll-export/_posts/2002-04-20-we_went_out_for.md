We went out for some beers last night, and didn&#8217;t get around to eating anything until 10.30. By this time our favourite fish and chip shop had closed. So, we decided to try Uncle Sams burger place. I should have read the description on the board better, but I didn&#8217;t and so was a bit surprised when I got home to discover that my Veggie Samwich was a bread cake, 2 slices of cheese and some salad &#8211; and that was all, nothing burger shaped. I won&#8217;t be ordering that again :-(.
