Last birthday I decided to write myself a set of &#8220;resolutions&#8221;, or more probably intentions for the year in which I was 36.

Those intentions were:

Attend a photography course

Eat organic food when possible

Eat local food when possible

Make the most of my Madgex ILP time

Exercise at least twice a week

Do photography projects

Visit an IFA and do a full financial review

Get a massage once a month

So, 13 months later, and looking back, how did I do?

Attend a photography course &#8211; yup, I did a weekend [Creative Digital Photography](http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/creative%20digital%20photography.html) course at Evolution in Brighton

Eat organic food when possible &#8211; hard to quantify, but most food eaten at home has been organic, or at least local. Eating out and lunchtimes is harder, but fortunately Brighton has a good collection of different eateries.

Eat local food when possible &#8211; see point 2 above

Make the most of my Madgex [ILP](http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/ilp.html) time &#8211; unfortunately, the cost cutting removed this in November, but I did use quite a lot of time to investigate tools and techniques and have also presented on the topics of Photography and Visual Studio Hints and Tips, ran [SQL coding dojo](http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/labels/CodingDojo.html)s and a [SQL Snap](http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/2008/08/sql-snap.html) session. Most of these have been written up on my [technical(ish) blog](http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/blog.html)

Exercise at least twice a week &#8211; after a slow start, I started [running](/tag/running/) in July following the [c25k](/tag/c25k/) programme and did well enough with this to take part in a 3.8K race in November raising &#xA3;625 for the [Alzheimer&#8217;s Society](http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/index.php). I kept this up and ran the (very soggy) [Santa Dash 5K](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/12/brighton_santa_dash) in December, and had planned to run the Race for Life 10K in July this year. Training was going ok until [Skitters](/tag/skitters/) arrived, and now running has been overtaken by dog walking &#8211; lots of it &#8211; and I&#8217;m cancelling my place in the Race for life.

Do photography projects &#8211; to be honest I haven&#8217;t done anything like the number of projects I&#8217;d optimistically hoped for, but I have worked on my [Lego Santa](http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/lego.html) project.

Visit an IFA and do a full financial review &#8211; after several years of no financial advice both Richard and I sat down with a new IFA and had a full financial health-check. Our new IFA visits us every 3 or so months and keeps us up to date with what is best for our situation. This has been well worth doing.

Get a massage once a month &#8211; hmm, no, not once a month, but probably every other month. Must try harder

I haven&#8217;t got a list for this year, so maybe it should be something I reserve for even years ðŸ™‚
