After my [accident on Thursday](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/05/accidents_3_jane_0), I bought some [Activheal plasters](http://www.savlon.co.uk/activheal/productcuts_frame.html) (supposedly help your wound to heal better &#8211; certainly worked pretty well, only my cut was in such an awkward place that it was hard to get a plaster to stick so I gave up after 2 days). On the back of the packet it says &#8220;Use once only&#8221;. Please tell me people don&#8217;t re-use plasters.
