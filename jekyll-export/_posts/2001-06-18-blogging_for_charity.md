Just noticed a link off the blogger front page about blogging for charity. The page reads : 

_&#8220;About a year ago, I blogged for 24 hours straight. It was fun, but did little more than get attention. When I decided to do it again this year, I knew it had to mean something. So I&#8217;m blogging for a cause&#8211;and so are some other folks. Here&#8217;s how it works: 
  
The show starts on Saturday, July 28, High Noon (Pacific time). We&#8217;ll go until noon on Sunday, July 29. 
  
Participants agree to make an entry on their personal page at least once every 30 minutes for 24 hours. Sponsors fork out for every hour the blogger manages to keep going, 24 hours max, or they decide on a flat fee instead. Each participant has chosen a favorite charity and provided a link. At the end of the marathon, sponsors make a donation to the appropriate charity.&#8221;_
