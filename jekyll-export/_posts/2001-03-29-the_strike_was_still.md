The strike was still happening when it was time to go home. I left the office at around 6pm and decided to try my luck at Farringdon tube station as the Metropolitan line was running a limited service between Liverpool Street and Amersham. They weren&#8217;t joking about limited. I stood on the station for around half an hour before getting fed up and deciding to walk again. (I would have had to walk between Baker Street and Paddington anyways). So, off I trotted, back the same route as this morning. The queues for the buses were too long to wait in (and having waited 30 minutes already, I just couldn&#8217;t face any more standing around). So, I eventually made it to Paddington and onto a train back to Ealing. I&#8217;ve not been so physically tired for a long time. I reckon I walked around 6 miles today just to get to work. Now that&#8217;s dedication&#8230;
