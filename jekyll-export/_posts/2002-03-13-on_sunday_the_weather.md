On Sunday, the weather was too windy really for a bike ride, so we thought we&#8217;d take the [kite](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/newjanus/) out instead. We headed off to Tysecombe Tye and got the kite out of the bag, and started unwinding the cables. Unfortunately, it was just so windy that Rich had to hold the kite down whilst I tried to sort the lines out, bah! major tangles, so we gave up and put it back into the bag. Next time we try and fly it, it&#8217;s going to take quite some time to sort out.

We didn&#8217;t feel like just heading home, so we went to Camber Sands instead as we knew that this was a favourite spot with kite buggiers. There were loads of them out and about, but we didn&#8217;t spend much time there as it was just too windy.
