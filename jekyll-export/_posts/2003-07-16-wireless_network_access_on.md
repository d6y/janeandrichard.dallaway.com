Wireless network access on the beach here in Brighton is becoming popular &#8211; there are now 2 places where you can get wifi (for free). The first is at Bar de la Mer (operated by [Loose Connection](http://wireless.looseconnection.com/)) and the second is Riptide (operated by [PiertoPier](http://www.piertopier.net/)).

PiertoPier have even been mentioned on [BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3068915.stm).
