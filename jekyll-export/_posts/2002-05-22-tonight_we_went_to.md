Tonight we went to see The Two Terries ([Terry Jones](http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,6000,402366,00.html) and [Terry Pratchett](http://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/)) on stage at The Dome Concert Hall. We didn&#8217;t really know what to expect, and given that the Terries had never met before tonight, I guess they didn&#8217;t either. 

For us, the worst thing it could have been was very very Literary &#8212; but it turned out to be mostly anecdote telling followed by questions at the end. There was a host to keep things moving, so all in all it was sort of like a chat show.
  
An entertaining chat show. For example: Terry Jones telling us about what life in the 14th century would have been like for a food taster to the Pope; or how the restaurant where the [Mr Creosote](http://bau2.uibk.ac.at/sg/python/Images/tmol02.jpg) scene from The Meaning of Life was being used the next day for a wedding; or how Terry Pratchett may or may not stumble around hotel rooms at 5am trying to avoid peeing in the wardrobe. 

One of the stranger things: Terry Jones showed us the scar he acquired after being in hospital. Apparently the surgeon took a photo of Terry while they were working on or around his intestines&#8230;and then emailed him [the photo](http://pythonline.com/plugs/jones/hospital.pt2.shtml) (warning: that link not for the faint hearted or those eating). 

The DVD of [Monty Python and the Holy Grail](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005U0HG/richarddallaway) sounds good at least for the subtitles for &#8220;people who don&#8217;t like the movie&#8221;, and we&#8217;ll have to go check out some of Terry Jones&#8217; [books](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141307374/richarddallaway). Jane already has pretty much all of the Pratchett [books](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385601239/richarddallaway) already.

Oh, brilliant moment: when it came round to time for questions, the first person stood up and said &#8220;This is a question for Terry&#8221; ðŸ™‚
