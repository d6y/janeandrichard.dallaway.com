Yesterday we went up a near-by hill in search of a breeze to fly our [new kite](http://www.spirit-of-air.demon.co.uk/sabre.html). We didn&#8217;t find a strong enough wind, but we did find good views of the [London Eye](http://www.dallaway.com/photos/londoneye/) and the Millennium Dome. 

We decided to head off and find the Newbury Kite Festival at
  
[Thatcham](http://www.multimap.co.uk/map/browse.cgi?client=europe&overviewmap=ap&addr1=&width=700&client=europe&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&db=hcgaz&cname=United+Kingdom&X=451119&Y=167680&scale=100000&place=Thatcham,+West+Berkshire&coordsys=gb), figuring these guys would probably have picked a location for a festival where there&#8217;s likely to be a good wind. Actually, the wind wasn&#8217;t that great for us beginners, but we did get our kite off the ground. 

The first picture, above, shows some formation flying. We saw quite a bit of this&#8230; all set to music, of course.

The second picture is of one of the music structures placed around the festival. It&#8217;s a statue with strings, and the strings sound as the wind passed through them. Cool.

We also saw huge parafoil kite (tied down to a car), stacks, kite buggies, kites fighting, and &#8230; that&#8217;s all I can remember.
