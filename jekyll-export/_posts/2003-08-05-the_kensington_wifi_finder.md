The [Kensington Wifi Finder](http://www.kensington.com/html/3720.html) looks like an interesting gadget. It&#8217;s a wifi finder so you can just look at the lights to see if there&#8217;s a wifi connection where you are &#8211; without having to get the laptop out. Sounds cool&#8230; now I just need a laptop that is luggable&#8230;
