While I was in San Francisco [Goul](http://www.goulbourn.com/) took me to see [Finding Nemo](http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/findingnemo/index.html) (watch the trailers: they can do water now). It&#8217;s a [Pixar](http://www.pixar.com/) and Disney thing, and if you liked [Toy Story](http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/ts/index.html), you&#8217;ll like this too. I&#8217;m looking forward to going to see it again, but it&#8217;s not due in the UK until October.
