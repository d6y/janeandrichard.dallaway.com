We popped along to the [Badger Music](http://www.badgermusic.co.uk/) night at the Western Front [again](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/08/two_thumbs_up_to) on Tuesday and had another fun evening. As we arrived Prince Rodger were just setting up, a 2 piece featuring a cello. The cello and the double bass are two of my favourite instruments, probably because one of the guys I shared a house with at Uni owned both, and the cello lived in our house and some Sunday mornings I&#8217;d wake up to the sound of a cello drifting up the stairs. Anyways, the second band were [And His Voice Became](http://www.myspace.com/ahvb), a great 2 piece act from London, featuring a drum kit, a guitar and a [loop station](http://www.bossus.com/index.asp?pg=1&tmp=24) used to excellent effect, and very good they were too. The final act were [The Bobby McGee&#8217;s](http://www.myspace.com/thebobbymcgees) who were, quite simply, mad. But wonderful too, with a drum kit, a double bass and 2 singers armed with ukulele, banjo and a [melodica](http://www.melodicas.com/melodicas.htm). An excellent band to see live.
