We watched the 1978 film &#8220;[The Thirty-Nine Steps](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0078389)&#8221; the other week. We&#8217;d [recorded it](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml) off the TV because whilst we were looking for a house in Brighton, we kept hearing parts of the story being read on BBC Radio 4 and thought we&#8217;d like to know the full story (we didn&#8217;t hear it all). What was strange though was that the story didn&#8217;t seem to be what we remembered. Certain key things had changed (like where Scudder was killed and how Richard Hannay escaped). We weren&#8217;t sure which version was correct, so I started to read the [text](http://www.memoware.com/cgi-bin/mwsearch.cgi?Any=%27The+Thirty-nine+Steps%27+) on my PDA. I&#8217;ve only read the first chapter so far, but it seems that the Radio 4 adaptation was more true to the book than the 1978 film was.

Interestingly enough, there appear to be another 2 books in the series, as the Richard Hannay books are a trilogy. The other books are [Greenmantle](http://www.memoware.com/cgi-bin/mwsearch.cgi?Any=Greenmantle) and [Mr Standfast](http://www.memoware.com/cgi-bin/mwsearch.cgi?Any=%27Mr.+Standfast%27+).
