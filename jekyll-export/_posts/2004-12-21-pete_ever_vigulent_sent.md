The BBC described some cash point (ATM) trickery [back in 2003](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3157214.stm), and although [Barclays](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4101391.stm) have made some machine modifications to reduce the risks, [new cons](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/20/pin_security_warning/) are always in beta.
