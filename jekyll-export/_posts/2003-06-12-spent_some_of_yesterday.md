I spent some of yesterday at the [In-store Design and Marketing show](https://raq2.globaleffect.net/cgi-bin/start.cgi/files/instore/initialise.html?workdetail=zvmad) at Earls Court, which was, er, very quiet. The [product I&#8217;ve been working on](http://www.fluidnetwork.com) for the last 18 months was being demonstrated as part of [Augustin Martin](http://www.augustusmartin.com/)&#8216;s product porfolio and so I went along to have a look around the rest of the show as well as to get an idea of the reception. I had chats with a few interesting companies, and they all said the same thing &#8211; the turnout was dissapointing. In fact, a lot of them were happy to chat to me (a techy and not a retail marketer) just to pass some time. Still, it was a day out of the office and a chance to collect some more promotional pens ðŸ™‚
