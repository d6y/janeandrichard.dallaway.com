For anyone who missed the [NotCon&#8217;04](http://www.notcon04.com) (like me), there&#8217;s now [audio and video](http://www.ejhp.net/notcon/) to watch. 

[NTK](http://www.ntk.net) described NotCon as: &#8220;is an informal, low-cost, one-day conference on things that technologies were perhaps not intended to do&#8221;. I can recommend &#8220;Telling the time (not very accurately) using a Marks & Spencer prawn sandwich and a BBC micro&#8221;.
