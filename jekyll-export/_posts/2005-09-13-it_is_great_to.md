It is great to see so many [great add on products](http://shop.ipodworld.co.uk/iPodWorldSite/category/iPodShuffle/) for the [iPod Shuffle](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodshuffle/) &#8211; I&#8217;m quite taken with these [PodGear Pocket Party Shuffle Speakers](http://shop.ipodworld.co.uk/iPodWorldSite/product/iPodShuffle_Speakers/PG19.htm). Admittedly I don&#8217;t need any as we&#8217;ve still got some [more normal portable speakers](http://www.argos.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10001&langId=-1&catalogId=3801&productId=160821&Trail=C%24cip%3D29001.Portable%2Bspeakers&categoryId=29001&clickfrom=name) that work admirably well. Needing is different to wanting though ðŸ™‚
