Okay, so we&#8217;ve all seen the geek joke about [upgrading girlfriend version 1.0 to wife version 1.0](http://www.drunkcow.com/content/420.html) etc, well an american has [taken it one step further](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3451207.stm). His poor son appears to have been named Jon Blake Cusack 2.0. I&#8217;m kind of surprised that I can&#8217;t find a website announcing the upgrade although I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s only time.
