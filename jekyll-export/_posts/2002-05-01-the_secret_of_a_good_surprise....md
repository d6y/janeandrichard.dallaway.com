&#8230;is that it should be a surprise, but not a shock. We had fun at [Jane&#8217;s Surprise 30th Birthday Party](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/surprise/), but for the first couple of hours Jane was still shaking. This is the kind of &#8220;surprise&#8221; you have when you&#8217;ve been in a car accident. So, for anyone organizing these things for anyone else: consider dropping them a few clues &#8212; or be prepared to warm up the [defibrillator](http://www.howstuffworks.com/emergency-room7.htm).
