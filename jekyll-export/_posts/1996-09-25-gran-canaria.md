**September 1996**

This was a &#8220;between jobs&#8221; holiday and as so was booked about a week before we left the UK. The hotel was okay, we were on half board and the food was a selection of hot buffet dishes, it was okay but nothing special.
  
We spent a lot of time just lazing in the sun, and the there were 2 pools, one for swimming, and one plunge pool, with a slide (great fun). The vilage of Playa del Cura is not very far away
  
from Puerto Rico, but doesn&#8217;t have a huge selection of bars or restaurants.

We went on three trips with the operator. The first was to one of the Water parks, which was great fun. Lots of slides and the like. It was a gorgeous day as well. The second trip was going pony trekking, which again was great. This included a barbeque meal afterwards and the food was okay but nothing really special. The third trip was going on a pub crawl around Puerto Rico, which turned out to be quite a laugh, but we didn&#8217;t stay until the end.

Overall opinion: it&#8217;s quieter than Puerto Rico, and some of the hotels which the operator were offering in Puerto Rico were at the top of a big hill so more convenient in that way.
