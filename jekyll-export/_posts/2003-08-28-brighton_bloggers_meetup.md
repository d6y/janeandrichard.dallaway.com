So, tonight was the [Brighton Bloggers](http://www.brightonbloggers.com/) first meetup. And, of course, [Jeremy](http://www.adactio.com/journal/display.php/20030828192628.xml) and [Pete](http://www.petebarrwatson.com/pm/comments.php?id=P263_0_1_0) were blogging from the event (we were at [Grand Central](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/at_the_bar/grandcentral.html), complete with wifi provided by [Loose Connection](http://www.looseconnection.com/).)
