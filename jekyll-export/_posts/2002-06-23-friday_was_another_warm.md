Friday was another warm evening where we ended up having a couple of beers on the beach, this time at
  
[Gemini bar](http://www.itchybrighton.co.uk/venues/369.html) (see also: [this review](http://www.brightonlife.com/reviews/reviews_add.php3?venue_id=67)). Then we jumped on train to go and see our friends at [New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/) who were having a party at [Ormonds](http://www.ormonds.com/) in London to celebrate their winning the [Interactive Consumer Magazine of the Year](http://www.ppa.co.uk/pr/2002/0508oscars.htm) award. It was great to catch up with everyone (thanks for invite!) and well done, guys!
