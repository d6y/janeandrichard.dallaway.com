My bank knows my email address and mobile phone number. It can send me emails, and it can text me &#8212; in fact it does both already. So when I go to a cash machine (ATM), why am I offered a printed receipt? Why not just SMS or email me the receipt? There&#8217;s no a security issue, because I&#8217;ve seen people leave those receipts in the machine or on the floor near the cash point. 

If I&#8217;m going to be emailed a cash withdrawn receipt, why not attach something to the email I can drag and drop into my financial software. And if the banks could do it, why not the credit card companies for every transaction I make.

Not only would this be useful, we&#8217;d also save the 10 kerjillion megakilos of paper used every year by receipt printers.
