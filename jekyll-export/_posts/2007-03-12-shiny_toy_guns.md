We went to see [Shiny Toy Guns](http://www.shinytoyguns.com/) at [The Pressure Point](http://www.pressurepoint.me.uk/second.html) this evening. Their track &#8220;Don&#8217;t Cry Out&#8221; was featured on the [Follow Me Around](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2007/01/follow_me_around) snowboard dvd by [Mack Dawg Productions](http://www.mackdawgproductions.com/) and as we loved the sound of them, we trotted off to HMV and bought the [album](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Are-Pilots-Shiny-Toy-Guns/dp/B000HXDETE/ref=pd_ka_1/203-9350751-6365568?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1173741706&sr=8-1/richarddallaway). After a bit more surfing we discovered that they were coming to Brighton as part of their [hectic UK and European tour](http://www.shinytoyguns.com/takinglives/) so we headed off, and had an excellent evening, first being rocked by [Viva Machine](http://www.myspace.com/vivamachine) and then being hugely entertained by Shiny Toy Guns. I can&#8217;t believe that it has taken me over 5 years living in Brighton to attend a gig at The Pressure Point!
