I played my first game of [squash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_%28sport%29) with [Suz](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/Susieleaving2/) [over 4 years ago](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/03/well_played_my_second) and we played together for about 6 months until she went back to New Zealand to be with the lovely Greg. I didn&#8217;t play for another year or so and then found a new squash buddy at work and have played once a week pretty much since October 2003. But no more. I&#8217;m forced to hang up my raquet and retire. A couple of weeks ago I started having some pain in my left knee, and my right shoulder, and today after little improvement I went to see the Doctors. The diagnosis is a torn muscle (probably [deltoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoid_muscle)) in my shoulder, and a [strained](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_%28injury%29) or [sprained](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprain) ligament in my left knee. The Doctor recommended that I give up squash, and if I don&#8217;t give it up I should wear a knee brace.

When I was young I often had knee problems, they would lock when I sat on the floor. I remember going dry slope skiing one time and not being able to walk for a couple of days. When I mentioned this to a previous Doctor I was told to be careful, and if I wanted to go skiing I should buy a knee brace. So, having been warned before I feel it is time to listen. Much as I&#8217;ve enjoyed squash, I enjoy snowboading more and after just [buying a new board](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/06/ride_kashmir_151), I&#8217;m not willing to risk that, and I don&#8217;t really get knee pain when snowboarding so I&#8217;m planning to continue.

So, I need a new sport that doesn&#8217;t involve lots of lateral knee movement. Suggestions from friends at work have been [shove ha&#8217;penny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shove_ha%27penny), [tiddlywinks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiddlywinks) and [cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards). Anybody got any slightly more active, but pretty low impact for knees suggestions?
