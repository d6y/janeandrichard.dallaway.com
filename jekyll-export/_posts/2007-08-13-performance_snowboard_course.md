We spent the weekend taking the excellent [SnowboardCoach.co.uk](http://www.snowboardcoach.co.uk/firstpage.htm) 2 day [Performance Course](http://www.snowboardcoach.co.uk/performance.htm) at [Xscape in Milton Keynes](http://www.xscape.co.uk/snow/milton-keynes/). We were a group of 8, and [Ash](http://www.snowboardcoach.co.uk/ashnewnesprofile.htm) managed to keep an eye on all of us giving feedback and advice &#8211; my main area to keep an eye on is not to use my upper body/shoulders to initiate turns. We did lots of drills, some designed to get us to understand the physics behind snowboarding, others to emphasise a point. An excellent course, which has really given me a desire to head off back to Milton Keynes soon and continue my practice.
