I&#8217;ve been meaning to set up a stocks and shares ISA for 2003/4 since about, er, last April but last week I finally got around to it. I had a conversation with a &#8220;finance aware&#8221; friend of mine who recommended I take a look at [Elson Associates](http://www.elsonassociates.com/). I did, and I was quite impressed by the amount of discount they offer off initial charges &#8211; it makes quite a difference and I&#8217;ll probably take a look at the 2004/5 offers after April.
