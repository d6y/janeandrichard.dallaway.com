Whilst I was looking for webcams of some of the ski areas we&#8217;re thinking of visiting, I stumbled across [SnowEye](http://www.snoweye.com/) which claims to have over 3000 webcams from ski resorts all over the world. They&#8217;re classified by country and region which makes it really easy (providing you know your geography) to get a glimpse of conditions. Now we&#8217;ve just got to hope that the webcams don&#8217;t show us huge greeny muddy areas like they would have done of [Fernie](http://www.snoweye.com/?page=ca-bc&detail=fernie) last year.
