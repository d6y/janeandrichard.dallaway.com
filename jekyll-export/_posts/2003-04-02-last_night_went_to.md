Last night I went to our [local camera club](http://www.photoclub.fsnet.co.uk/) for the first time. I had been thinking about going for a while, but didn&#8217;t think I was good enough and felt embarassed by my efforts. Over the weekend we popped along to their exhibition at the [Gardner Arts Centre](http://www.gardnerarts.co.uk/) and I realised that they had a wide cross-section of styles and talents, and that I wasn&#8217;t far behind some of them and so could probably learn by association.

Last night was a slide show by a Father and Son team. [Paul](http://www.paulreynolds.com/), the son, did a show on his different styles of photography and some were very impressive especially [this](http://www.paulreynolds.com/gallery/12.htm). Father, [Roger](http://www.rogerreynoldsfrps.com/), did a show based on photos he took during a trip to [Patagonia](http://www.photoventures.net/gallery/patagonia/images.htm) &#8211; some very impressive icebergs and glaciers. I have much to learn.

The club has a lot of, how do I put this politely?, older members, but the people I spoke to were all very nice and chatty, so I&#8217;ll probably go again.
