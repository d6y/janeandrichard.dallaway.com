The National Audit Office has reported [on UK Space activities](http://www.nao.org.uk/pn/03-04/0304359.htm). The glossy executive summary talks of the need for a &#8220;more consistent approach to the analysis of the risks&#8221;. 

Meanwhile, the story that [B2 may have been spotted on Mars](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4479868/) is dismissed by CP as noise in the image. The current theory is that [B2 was going too fast](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3543295.stm) when it hit the thinner than expected Martian atmosphere. Another avenue of investigation is an [anomaly in an image of B2 as it separated](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/09/1078594370654.html) from Mars Express. &#8220;The bright object and the glint on the side of Beagle 2 may be nothing, they may be everything&#8221;.

And the hunt for Beagle 1 has focused on [8ft of mud in the Essex marshes](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2004/03/10/ecfbeag10.xml&sSheet=/connected/2004/03/10/ixconn.html). &#8220;For the latter part of its life, the Beagle lived modestly as a coastguard watch vessel in Essex to combat gangs of smugglers in the Southend Coastguard District&#8221;.

Great news: There are plans to [relaunch B2](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3519626.stm) in 2007. Bad news for the guy who registered beagle3.com on Christmas day: the project will keep the B2 name.

It seems I&#8217;m part of the [Beagle generation](http://www.guardian.co.uk/spacedocumentary/story/0,2763,1159314,00.html): Britons who back greater investment in space research.
