I&#8217;ve just had to post my [Canon G3](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/CanonG3.xml) off for repair. There&#8217;s a little plastic tab on the cover for the CF slot which presses down and allows power to flow to the camera. Without the tab it doesn&#8217;t work. I know, mine just broke. :-(. Jessops (who we bought it from) told me it could take 4 -5 weeks to repair, so we rang Canon who said 10 &#8211; 15 working days. So we&#8217;ve sent it straight to Canon using the helpful people at [Mailboxes etc](http://www.mbeuk.ws/) on Western Road, Brighton.
