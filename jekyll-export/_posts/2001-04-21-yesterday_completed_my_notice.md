Yesterday I completed my notice period and left my job at [New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/). I&#8217;ve been working with them since the site launched on 5 October 1995. So, it&#8217;s going to be odd, but I needed to find something else to do and move out of London. Not sure what that will be. Hopefully I won&#8217;t miss the people, because I&#8217;m going to try to stay in touch ðŸ™‚

Thanks for the send off guys! And the geek toys! There are [more photos](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/eyemodule/ns.html).
