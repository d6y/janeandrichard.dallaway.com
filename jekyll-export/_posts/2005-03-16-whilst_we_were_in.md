Whilst we were in Canada last week we picked up a copy of [Frequency](http://www.frqncy.com/) snowboard magazine, which is along the same lines as [The snowboard Journal](http://www.futurenetworkusa.com/publications/snowboardjournal.html) which we have a subscription for. It&#8217;s another beautiful coffee-table type magazine and the issue we have (4.2) includes an interesting &#8220;UnResort&#8221; guide &#8211; heli and cat access etc.
