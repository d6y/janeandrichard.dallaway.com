Never watch a film that you know the ending of. That&#8217;s usually Richard&#8217;s view of films. I don&#8217;t agree with that totally, as it is often interesting to see how the book gets interpreted. Bridget Jones&#8217;s Diary is a book I read many years ago, and enjoyed (in a light reading kind of way &#8211; I read it on a flight to Kenya). The film is pretty well put together, and flows along nicely. It _was_ interesting to see how you can turn a book written as a diary into a film &#8211; it handles it well. It&#8217;s a fun film, no deep meaningful experience, but fun. I enjoyed it, it made me laugh.
