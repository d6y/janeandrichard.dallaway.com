Well, it is [festival](http://www.brightonfestival.org/) time again here in Brighton, and so today I headed off in search of the [Streets of Brighton](http://www.brightonfestival.org/event_details.aspx?eid=2375), [open houses](www.aoh.org.uk/) and [more](http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2007/05/41-places-update.html) of the [41 places](http://41places.org/) installations.

Despite having lived in Brighton for 5 festivals, I&#8217;d never ventured into an open house until today &#8211; and I&#8217;m converted. I visited 3 and found them all to be of a really high standard. The first was [Rod Clark](http://www.rodclark.org/).

The second and third were both down Tidy Street. They were [Shadow Box](http://www.robyndillon.co.uk/) and [SQ1](http://www.square-one.co.uk/openhouse/).

I will be visiting more of them. 

I managed to catch a few different street performances, the Deep Sea Jivers performed by [Swervy World](http://www.swervyworld.com/jivers.htm) and [Eco Pirates](http://www.desperatemen.com/?p=20) performed by [Desperate Men](http://www.desperatemen.com/).
