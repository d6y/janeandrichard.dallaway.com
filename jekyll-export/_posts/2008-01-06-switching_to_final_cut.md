I&#8217;ve been noodling around in iMovie for a few years, but there was plenty just bugging me and slowing me down with it. Mostly I found that going back and editing a sequence could really screw up the timing of the whole movie. So the logical thing to do was to move on, and I decided to move on to Final Cut Express (version 3.5 when I bought it). 

Here&#8217;s what happens: you install Final Cut and all the tools it comes with, fire it up all excited, and&#8230; panic. Then get frustrated that you&#8217;re doing less than you could in iMovie. Then get depressed. What I did, pretty much the same day I installed Final Cut, was go out and get a copy of [Final Cut Express HD 3.5 Editing](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FFinal-Cut-Express-Editing-Workshop%2Fdp%2F0240809459%2Fricharddallaway&tag=richarddallaway&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738). I found the book exactly what I needed, with a DVD containing sample projects I could work through to check I was getting the right end product, and a section on moving from iMovie to FCE. Recommended.

I&#8217;ve also found a couple of vodcasts that were helpful: [Creative COW Final Cut Pro Podcast](http://cowcast.creativecow.net/final_cut_pro/index.html) and [Final Cut Help Podcast](http://podcastingforacause.com/vasst.xml).

Turns out it&#8217;s not so daunting after all, but of course I always knew I could just phone [Ray](http://visualabuse.com/)&#8230;
