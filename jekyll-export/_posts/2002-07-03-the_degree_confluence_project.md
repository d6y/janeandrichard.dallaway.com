The [Degree Confluence Project](http://www.confluence.org/) is interesting: &#8220;The goal of the project is to visit each of the latitude and longitude integer degree intersections in the world, and to take pictures at each location&#8221;. There are 12,629 still to do, but France is now &#8220;done&#8221;.
