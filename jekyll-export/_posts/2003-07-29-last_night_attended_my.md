Last night I attended my first [Skillswap](http://skillswap.brightonnewmedia.org/) event. These are free events where the emphasis is on learning a new skill, and presented by a local expert. It was presented by Matt Zandstra (author of [Sams Teach Yourself PHP in 24 Hours](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672323117/richarddallaway)) and was all about PHP, Objects and Patterns. Matt also delved into some of the new features that PHP5 will provide when it&#8217;s released towards the end of this year.

I must admit that [Design Patterns](http://hillside.net/patterns/) are something that have been on the fringe of my knowledge for a long time, but that I&#8217;ve just never got around to learning more about, so it is good to now have a bit more of an idea. There were a couple of book recommendations mentioned during the night &#8211; [Design patterns : elements of reusable object-oriented software](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612/richarddallaway) and [A Little Java, a Few Patterns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262561158/richarddallaway) which I may have to take a closer look at.
