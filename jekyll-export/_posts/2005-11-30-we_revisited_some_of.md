We revisited some of my old [Aspect](http://www.aspectgroup.co.uk/) stomping grounds at the weekend. We stopped off at [Potemkin](http://www.potemkin.co.uk/) on the way to [Cathy](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/surprise/img_1698_640/)&#8216;s 40th birthday and had a few vodka shots &#8211; I had a sweet cranberry (a bit like cough medicine) and a honey (bit too strong for me), the others had mint, sage (tastes a bit like stuffing), blackcurrant (a bit like undiluted ribena), sweet aniseed, black vodka and hunter vodka. The following day we headed back into town to see [Dave](http://www.davehodgkinson.com/), and ended up in [The Food Bazaar](http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1150/24596.php) which was directly opposite the first Aspect office I worked in down Gray&#8217;s Inn Road. A great trip down memory lane.
