I was listening to [Andy Budd](http://www.andybudd.com/)&#8216;s [Web 2.0 talk](http://2005.dconstruct.org/mp3/AndyBudd.mp3) from last years [d.construct](http://2005.dconstruct.org/) conference this morning [on my way in to work](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/07/bought_myself_an_fm) and followed up on a few of the sites he mentioned as being good examples of Web 2.0.

One of the sites, [ononemap](http://ononemap.com/), looks like it would be a really useful aid to finding a house to buy, especially if you know the area you&#8217;re interested in as it overlays the properties for sale on top of [google maps](http://maps.google.com/).
