My new lenses for my [G3](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/CanonG3.xml) arrived today. I&#8217;ve bought a 2x telephoto lens (Kenko KNT 20) and a 0.72x wideangle lens (Raynox DCR 720), as well as a couple of Kenko lens adapters from [The Filter Connection](http://www.2filter.com/). Shame I [haven&#8217;t got a G3](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2003/05/ve_just_had_to) to put them on at the moment :-(, but hopefully it will be back at the end of the week.
