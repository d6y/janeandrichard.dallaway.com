We bought and dressed our Christmas tree last weekend. I&#8217;ve never had a real Christmas tree before (in fact, I&#8217;ve never owned a tree before as this is the first year that I&#8217;ll be spending Christmas at my house rather than at my folks&#8217;) and so it&#8217;s all quite exciting (okay, not really exciting but different anyways).

It&#8217;s not all that easy to tell from this picture, but the tree is only about 1.5 feet tall. We bought one in a pot in the hope that we can convince it to live.
