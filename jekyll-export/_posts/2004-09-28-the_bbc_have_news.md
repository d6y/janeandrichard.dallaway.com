The BBC have a [news story about rural transport](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3680484.stm) today, and one of their &#8220;Related Internet Links&#8221; is for the [Government guide to public transport](http://www.transportdirect.com/). This website allows you to put in your start and end points and travelling time and it will provide you with a list of journey options. Sounds pretty useful.
