To celebrate our second wedding anniversary we decided to head to New York. Armed with the [Time Out](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141010908/richarddallaway) guide, and the excellent books available from the [hotel](http://www.innon23rd.com/) (we recommend the [Frommers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002XM8MI/richarddallaway) as it had the best maps and restaurant sections), we explored the city in manageable chunks.

One day we explored Fifth Avenue, [Grand Central](http://www.grandcentralterminal.com/), Little Italy and Chinatown. The next we went up the [Empire State Building](http://www.esbnyc.com/) and visited Times Square at night. The next day was our anniversary and we spent the day around [Battery Park](http://www.batteryparkcity.org/), [Ground Zero](http://groundzero.nyc.ny.us/) and taking a trip on the [Staten Island Ferry](http://www.siferry.com/) before going out for a [wonderful meal](http://www.newyorkmetro.com/pages/details/2475.htm). On Wednesday it rained &#8211; the tail end of [hurricane Frances](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3625252.stm) [hit town](http://nyt.wieck.com/portal/wieck_preview_page_156821) &#8211; and our [Yankees](http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/index.jsp?c_id=nyy) game was cancelled, still we found a [good restaurant](http://www.in-newyorkmag.com/profiles/zocalo_profile.htm) to get over our disapointment in. Our last day saw us heading over to [Central Park](http://www.centralpark.org/) and taking a great walk before heading back off to Fifth Avenue for the last of the shopping. Our final evening we headed to the Hotel Metro and sat out on their (understated) [roof terrace](http://www.hotelmetronyc.com/phototour7.html#) looking up at the Empire State building (one block away).

A great trip, and we&#8217;ve left ourselves things to do should we get a chance to go back (like visit the [Guggenheim](http://www.guggenheim.org/) when it&#8217;s open as well as many other museums and galleries).
