I took Jane&#8217;s phone on a short cycle ride this morning to see how the [Nokia Sports Tracker](http://research.nokia.com/research/projects/SportsTracker/index.html) works when combined with the [6110](http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4366035)&#8216;s built in GPS. You can dig around [the route on Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/W20070904073656.kml).

It&#8217;s looking like the accuracy is OK (good enough) when away from buildings; and pretty wonky when in town. It doesn&#8217;t have the accuracy of our [Bluetooth GPS unit](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Globalsat-BT338-x-trac-bluetooth-receiver/dp/B00092759S/richarddallaway), but it does have the considerable advantage of being a nice all in one unit.

We&#8217;ll give it a go on a snowy mountain: it should be great for tracking a run down a mountain.
