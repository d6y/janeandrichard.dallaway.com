We popped into [Fabrica](http://www.fabrica.org.uk/) yesterday to see what was on display at the moment and found [Beneath the Stride](http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/artpages/brian_griffiths_beneath1.htm) of Giants by Brian Griffiths. It is a wooden boat, made from other people&#8217;s junk. 

Fabrica is such a lovely place to stop, it&#8217;s always peaceful and cool and its often hard to remember it is in such a busy location.<br clear="all" />
