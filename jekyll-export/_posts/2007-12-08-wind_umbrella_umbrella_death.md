The wind and rain were both making a typical winter appearance today, but I&#8217;ve never seen such an amount of umbrella death. Every bin, every pavement seemed to be littered with the debris.

[Richard](http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/) and [I](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157603407464291/) made an effort of recording [some of the carnage](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/weatherinducedumbrellawreckage/) with camera phones.
