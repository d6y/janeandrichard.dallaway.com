This is a photo of our technical director, Nick &#8211; he claims that his horses always look really happy when eating grass, so he thought he&#8217;d try it too. He had his own web site dedicated to his [love of horses](http://www.horses.co.uk), so you can see for yourself all about his current two horses, Bertie and George (George is pictured above).
