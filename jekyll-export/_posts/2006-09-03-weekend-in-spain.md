We spent a few days at the lovely [La Casa Del Olivar](http://www.lacasadelolivar.com/) with friends Jim and Lucy. La Casa is close to [Villanueva de Algaidas](http://canales.diariosur.es/fijas/pueblos/ingles/villaalgaidasi.htm), and only an hour or so from Malaga airport, so not bad for a weekend trip. 

The days were lovely and hot, and so tourism suffered as a lot of time was spent around the pool making up games involving an inflatable dolphin, 3 beach balls and 2 inflatable pillow things. 

We did manage a couple of trips and so headed off to [El Refugio del Burrito](http://www.elrefugiodelburrito.com/) where Jim was the definite friend of the donkeys, the flamingo lake at [Fuente de Piedra](http://www.andalucia.com/province/malaga/fuentepiedra/home.htm) and [Antequera](http://www.andalucia.com/antequera/home.htm), a lovely town dating back to the Bronze Age.
