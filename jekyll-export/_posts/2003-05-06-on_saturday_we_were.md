On Saturday we were at [Don&#8217;t look back](http://www.artsoutheast.co.uk/press_releases/dontlookback.cfm?state=internal), which was a non-tour of [Stanmer Park](http://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/stanmer_park_history.htm) with the theme of [Orpheus and Eurydice](http://www.hipark.austin.isd.tenet.edu/mythology/orpheus.html). So think death, think opening doors and seeing brides running away from you, think lots of stuff involving rivers. It was a non-tour because you were left to explore the crumbling house, and stumble across the various &#8220;sleepers&#8221; (actors) who were scattered around.

We had no idea what to expect, and it turned out to be a lovely, but slightly baffling, thing.
