I&#8217;ve never bought a live animal on-line before, but I&#8217;ve just found out that I can buy [ladybirds](http://www.wigglywigglers.co.uk/shop/foundproduct.lasso?product_id=219). They&#8217;re not cheap, but if it means they&#8217;ll eat the pests currently sitting on our strawberry plants, I&#8217;m tempted&#8230; but the risk is [what happened to &#8220;dna&#8221; of Ireland](http://www.spiritgarden.co.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=2618#2618) will happen to us.
