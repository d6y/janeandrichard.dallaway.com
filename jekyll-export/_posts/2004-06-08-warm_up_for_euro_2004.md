BBC News have a helpful article on [how to avoid getting an injury when watching football on the tv](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3786393.stm) based on a [factsheet](http://admin.csp.org.uk/admin2/uploads/2200d5-f7cdd2303d--7018/CSPFootballleafA5Inter.pdf) provided by [The Chartered Society of Physiotherapists](http://www.csp.org.uk/) [warning: very slow website]. It recommends _&#8220;In a situation when you can reasonably anticipate a goal, prepare your body by getting up off the sofa carefully so that you are already standing and then you can jump up and down, instead of springing off the sofa&#8221;_, as well as making sure food and drink are nearby to avoid incidents through &#8220;lunging&#8221;. It must be a slow news day!
