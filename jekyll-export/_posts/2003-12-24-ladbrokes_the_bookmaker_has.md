&#8220;Ladbrokes, the bookmaker, has cut its odds of finding life on Mars from 33-1 to 25-1&#8221;. Good luck [Beagle 2](http://www.beagle2.com/weblog/index.htm)! It seems that getting to Mars successfully is, historically, a 50:50 chance. We&#8217;ll know if Beagle 2 made it to the surface when we wake up on Christmas day.
