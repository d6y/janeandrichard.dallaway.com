On Tuesday, just after I&#8217;d got home from work, Kirsty called to ask me if I could help her. Jeremy and Duncan had gone out on a bike ride, and had both fallen off their bikes and injured themselves. Kirsty came around and collected me in her [truck](http://www.hondacars.com/models/model_overview.asp?ModelName=CR-V&bhcp=1&BrowserDetected=True), and we headed off to find them. Fortunately they&#8217;d gone on a ride I know well, and so with the help of the OS map we were able to find them. We dropped them off at the hospital, then unpacked the bikes before Kirsty headed back to sit in A&E for 4 or so hours. The diagnosis was that Duncan had fractured the tip of his finger, and Jeremy had to have 14 stiches in a nasty cut on his forearm.
