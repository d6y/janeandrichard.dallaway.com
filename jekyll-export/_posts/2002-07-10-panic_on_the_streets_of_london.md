Panic gripped the streets of London this morning when patches of sky took on an unusual blue colour and a ball of fire appeared above the city. 

The phenomenon, known as &#8216;The Sun&#8217; and commonly found in Mediterranean countries, unleashed a terrifying heat and brightness upon the capital, causing many pedestrians to take off their hats and scarves, while motorists were able to turn both their headlights and wipers off. Tony Blair urged people to be calm and return to work as normal stating: &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen this sort of thing before&#8221;, he said,&#8221;but it never lasts.&#8221; 

There are forecasts that &#8216;The Sun&#8217; could be seen throughout the weekend but a spokesman for No.10 said, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath&#8221;.
