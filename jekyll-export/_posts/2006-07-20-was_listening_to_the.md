I was listening to the [Connected Traveller](http://connectedtraveler.com/) : [Travel News/Odds &#8216;n&#8217; Ends](http://connectedtraveler.com/wordpress/?p=121) this morning and one of the items was about [The Happy Planet Index](http://www.happyplanetindex.org/list.htm) which is an index of human well-being and environmental impact. The [UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) is pretty low with a HPI (Happy Planet Index) of 40.3. The top of the index is [Vanuatu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu) with an HPI of 68.2. The lowest is [Zimbabwe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe) with 16.6 where life expectancy is only 36.9 years.

You can [calculate your own HPI](http://www.itint.co.uk/hpisurvey/). I scored 29.7 which isn&#8217;t very good, but seems to be pretty badly affected on ecological footprint which for me is 8.62 global hectares, or the equivalent of 4.79 planets &#8211; oops! Most of this is due to my 30 mile each way trip to work, and my flights to the US/Canada for snowboarding. We&#8217;re pretty good with recycling, but I need to be better at [turning electrical appliances off rather than leaving them in standby](http://www.national-student.co.uk/Features/Article%20TURN%20IT%20OFF.htm).
