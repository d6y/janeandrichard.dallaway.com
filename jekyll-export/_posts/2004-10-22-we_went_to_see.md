We went to see the [Perrier Comedy Awards show in Brighton](http://www.brightoncomedyfestival.com/theperrierawardshow.asp) last night. It was compared by [Adam Hills](http://www.funny.co.uk/stand-up-comedy/art_62-2404-Adam-Hills.html), and starred [Will Hodgson](http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/whodgson.html) (winner of the 2004 Best newcomer), [Sarah Kendall](http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/skendall.html) (a nominee), [Jackson&#8217;s Way](http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/news.cfm?id=1007222004) (winner of the 2004 Perrier Comedy Award) and finished off with non-perrier nominee [Marcus Brigstocke](http://www.marcusbrigstocke.com/) (who was filling in for Reginald D Hunter).

Jackson&#8217;s Way and Marcus Brigstocke were excellent, the other two didn&#8217;t seem to have the experience to cope with a gig in the [Brighton Dome](http://www.brighton-dome.org.uk/) in front of 1000 people. Yet again, I found myself leaving a comedy show feeling that I don&#8217;t see half as much live comedy as I should.
