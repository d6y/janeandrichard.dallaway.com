Brighton booze: The council have OKed [24-hour drinking](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/3725004.stm), while the headline of the Argus is that the Sussex [Police chief attacks 24-hour drinking](http://www.theargus.co.uk/the_argus/news/NEWS0.html).

The Argus headline is a little misleading, because the Sussex chief constable is actually against [the sale of cheap alcohol](http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,11026,1323972,00.html), and would rather have tax income to help pay for the policing of binge drinking. That&#8217;s the same binge drinking that the council is hoping to control with the [new 24-hour licensing](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/site01.cfm?request=c1134081). 

The first licenses will come into effect late in 2005, so it looks like we&#8217;re in for an interesting, experimental, summer in 2006&#8230;
