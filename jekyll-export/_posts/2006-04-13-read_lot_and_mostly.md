I read a lot, and mostly crime or thrillers at the moment. I&#8217;ve discovered a few new authors recently &#8211; [Peter Robinson](http://www.inspectorbanks.com/) ([Strange Affair](http://www.inspectorbanks.com/strange.html), [Cold as the grave](http://www.inspectorbanks.com/cold.html) and [The Summer that never was](http://www.inspectorbanks.com/summer.html) &#8211; all of which are excellent are revolve around the same characters), [Tess Gerritsen](http://www.tessgerritsen.com/) ([Body Double](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553815032/richarddallaway)) and [Karin Slaughter](http://www.karinslaughter.com/) ([Indelible](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099462249/richarddallaway)), all of which are proving to be good reads. Any other authors I should be looking for?
