The other day we were lost for a moment in Brighton, driving around a new development
  
called the [New England Quarter](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1000336). &#8220;New England Quarter&#8221;&#8230;. Ok, nice enough name. 

A few days later, I spotted that we also have an Artist Quarter on the beach.

So does this mean there&#8217;s a land grab in progress? Quick! Get a sign up and grab your quarter before they&#8217;re all gone.
