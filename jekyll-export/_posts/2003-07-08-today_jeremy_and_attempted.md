Today Jeremy and I attempted our maddest plan yet, to cycle part of the South Downs Way from Amberley to Brighton. We&#8217;re both in our notice period having been made redundant last week, so we thought it would be a good opportunity to get out there and pedal. 26 miles later and I&#8217;m absolutely exhausted although nothing aches as yet. The photo above was taken at Chanctonbury Ring (probably the highest point on our ride at around 238m).
