I&#8217;ve just been looking around the internet searching for somewhere selling [The West Wing Series 1](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068OVR/richarddallaway) cheaper than [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/), and I stumbled across [Priceclash](http://www.priceclash.co.uk/) who do comparison shopping for DVDs, videos, CDs and games but who seem to cover far more stores than Kelkoo or any of the other alternatives. One to bookmark I think.
