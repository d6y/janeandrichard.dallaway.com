We had a lovely weekend in [Stratford and Warwick](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622634774565/). We stayed at the Swan&#8217;s Nest Hotel which was one of the [MacDonald hotels](http://www.macdonaldhotels.co.uk/) covered in the recent 2 for 1 deal which Sainsbury&#8217;s have been running. The hotel was good, but I think overall I would have been a little dissapointed if I&#8217;d paid full price for it (the service wasn&#8217;t that great). The food in the restaurant was pretty good though both for breakfast and for our Saturday evening dinner.

I hadn&#8217;t been to Stratford since I was at school when we went to see Macbeth at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. Unfortunately the [RSC](http://www.rsc.org.uk/) weren&#8217;t &#8220;at home&#8221; and so we didn&#8217;t get to go and see a play. I was surprised by how busy everything was, even on a wet Saturday in March and I&#8217;m glad that we didn&#8217;t decide to go during summer.

Having explored Stratford on Saturday we decided to head off to [Warwick Castle](http://www.warwick-castle.co.uk) on Sunday and spent the day exploring (and taking photographs) there.

All in all a great weekend, it just finished too soon.
