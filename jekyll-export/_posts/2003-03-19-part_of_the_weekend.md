Part of the weekend was handed over to painting wood and messing with lighting in the house. There&#8217;s something quite special when you unscrew a ceiling lighting fixture expecting to find three wires only to discover ten. Mmm.. I just love our [British wiring standards](http://www.electrical-installations-rewiring.co.uk/change-light-fitting.html).

Anyway, today I was in our [local shopping centre](http://www.brightonchurchillsquare.co.uk/) looking for a few bits a pieces and there was a lovely dog running around &#8211; friendly thing, dashing up to people and sniffing and being all curious the way dogs are. Then I found this sign: &#8220;POLICE &#8211; DRUG DOG TRAINING&#8221;. And I thought s/he was being friendly, not frisking me. Still, they&#8217;d probably make great pets when they retire.
