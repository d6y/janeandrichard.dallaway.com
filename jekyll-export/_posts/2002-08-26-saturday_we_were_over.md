Saturday: we were over at [Rob & Sue](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/henstagday/img_2466_640/)&#8216;s place for Rob&#8217;s 30th birthday party/BBQ. Ace time, great people, and someone bought Rob a [Swingball](http://www.sportime.com/products/swingball.shtml) but we headed off back home before it came out of its box. We then got lost trying to drive out of [Kingston](http://kingstononline.co.uk/), but that&#8217;s normal: it seems you have to drive around the one-way system a few times until you reach [escape velocity](http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae158.cfm).
