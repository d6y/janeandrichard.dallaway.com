We had a bit of a country pub crawl on Saturday night. We started off for dinner at [The Ram Inn, Firle](http://www.theram-inn.com/) which was really good &#8211; a nice pub, with a lovely atmosphere, [good beer](http://www.harveys.org.uk/) and an impressive menu (small, but carefully prepared). We headed off through Glynde, nearly lost a wing mirror to a 4 wheel drive full of paragliders who were too adrenalin filled to drive sensibly on narrow country lanes before arriving at [The Cock Inn, Ringmer](http://www.cockpub.co.uk/) for a half of [Old Ale](http://www.ratebeer.com/findbeer.asp). We then headed off to the [Half Moon](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/23/23621/Half_Moon_Inn/Plumpton) at [Plumpton](http://www.knowhere.co.uk/468_eatdrink.html) for a half of [Old Cocky](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/weltons-old-cocky/35761/) before finishing off at the [White Horse in Ditchling](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/12/12936/White_Horse/Ditchling). A great evening.
