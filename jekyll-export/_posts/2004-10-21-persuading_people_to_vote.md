Persuading people to vote seems to be a big thing in the US at the moment. First [Michael Moore](http://www.michaelmoore.com/) does his [noodles for votes](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3719154.stm) offer, and now [votergasm](http://www.votergasm.org/) are [using sex pledges](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3762028.stm) to _boost voter turnout among young people, as well as promoting safe, consensual sex_.
