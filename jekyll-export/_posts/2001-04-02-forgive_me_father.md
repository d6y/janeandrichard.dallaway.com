Forgive me father&#8230; it has been 11 days since I last blogged. One of the things that&#8217;s been keeping me busy is the time spent on cleaning up some old photographs.

The first picture (above) is the original that I&#8217;m working on, and to the right are the &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; shots showing some of the detail. It&#8217;s sloooooooow work, and there&#8217;s much to do.

The picture, BTW, is of me and my sister, taken sometimes in the &#8217;70s I guess. The next one to start work on, should I ever finish this one, is of my mum from the 1950s&#8230;.
