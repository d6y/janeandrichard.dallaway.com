I&#8217;ve been [reading up on the Playstation 3](http://redherring.com/insider/2002/0719/playstation071902.html) and in particular how it&#8217;s going to be able to call up extra computing power to do&#8230;well&#8230; whatever it needs to do to make games better.

Some people think this &#8220;grid computing&#8221; is best for [big business and academia](http://www.catchoday.com/archives/362.html), and some people think it&#8217;ll let us run [weather forecasts for our own back gardens](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2141200.stm), but I like the idea for games. But still&#8230; I&#8217;ll believe it when the PS3 ships. I can see how it would help simulations, but I can&#8217;t see how it&#8217;d work to speed up graphics.

Anyway, that&#8217;s just an intro to my current fave on-line cartoon. Before I give you the link, you need to know something about the cartoon Voltron by reading up on [
  
one of the characters](http://looneytunys.com/allura.html) and you also need to know that [Devastator](http://iocon.com/cj/tf/techspecs/devastat.htm) is a Transformer that&#8217;s a &#8220;bizarre combination of six Constructicons: Scrapper, Scavenger, Bonecrusher, Hook, Long Haul, and Mixmaster&#8221;. Ok, here&#8217;s the [cartoon](http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2002-08-08).
