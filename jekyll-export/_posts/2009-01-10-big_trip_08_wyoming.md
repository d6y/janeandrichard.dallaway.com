This was the fifth and final place we stayed on our [BigTrip](/tag/bigtrip08/).

The drive from Big Sky to Jackson took us past the incredible [Yellowstone National Park](http://www.nps.gov/yell/) &#8211; if our drive had been shorter, and it hadn&#8217;t been snowing, we&#8217;d have popped in to the park to take a look &#8211; maybe next time! Our accommodation in Jackson was at the [Elk Country Inn](http://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g60491-d248257-Reviews-Elk_Country_Inn-Jackson_Wyoming.html), a reasonably well equipped log cabin within an easy, if cold (-20 deg C) walk of the many restaurants and shops.

Our first stop was [Jackson Hole](http://www.jacksonhole.com/), a resort we&#8217;ve heard a lot about, but which we found somewhat disappointing. Yes, it was steep, but that was about it. No tree runs like we&#8217;d found at Moonlight, it was busy &#8211; even when it snowed it got tracked out really quickly, and I think we&#8217;d been totally spoilt by Montana. But we still had fun on our 2 days, and celebrated Richard&#8217;s 40th birthday there.

The next day we headed off to [Grand Targhee](http://www.grandtarghee.com/), in deep, fresh, powder, with really limited visibility. I wasn&#8217;t feeling great, and so we only managed a half day, but we had some great fun playing amongst the trees with almost no idea what runs we were on, and where we were heading for. After a day off for me to attempt a recovery, we returned to Grand Targhee, on a day when we could see and managed a couple of runs before I had to retire ill. It was a very different experience the second day, and we realised that Grand Targhee isn&#8217;t a very big hill, but it gets a huge amount of snow.

Wyoming was a bit of a disappointment &#8211; we&#8217;d expected Jackson to be amazing &#8211; it was the last stop on our trip because we wanted to improve so we were good enough to appreciate it based on it&#8217;s reputation. Maybe we didn&#8217;t reach a high enough level, or maybe we peaked at Montana and learnt more about what makes the perfect snowboard resort for us, but Wyoming wasn&#8217;t the amazing final stop we&#8217;d planned.

From [my sportstracker log](https://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/user/profile.do?u=janedallaway) in Wyoming we did: 

  * 2nd Mar &#8211; Jackson Hole &#8211; 23.64
  * 3rd Mar &#8211; Jackson Hole &#8211; 23.61
  * 4th Mar &#8211; Grand Targhee &#8211; 11.43
  * 6th Mar &#8211; Grand Targhee &#8211; 5.55 &#8211; a token gesture as I wasn&#8217;t well, but couldn&#8217;t leave without a return to Targhee

A total for Wyoming of 64.23 miles.
