The things you learn watching [QI](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/qi/) actually are quite interesting. Here in the UK [VAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax) is not charged on cakes, or on biscuits unless &#8220;wholly or partly covered in chocolate (or some product similar in taste and appearance)&#8221;. This led to Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs (n&#x00E9;e Customs and Excise) [investigating the Jaffa Cake](http://www.jamescowper.co.uk/ar58.html). The ruling rested on the fact the biscuits go soft when stale, whereas cakes go hard when stale. [Jaffa Cakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_Cakes) go hard and are therefore cakes, and not subject to VAT. The clue&#8217;s in the name. 

For those who want the full rules, you might want to look at HM Revenue and Customs Notice [701/14](http://www.hmrc.com/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_CL_000118) (PDF) which helpfully clarifies that VAT does apply to &#8220;any item of sweetened prepared food, other than cakes and non-
  
chocolate biscuits, which is normally eaten with the fingers.&#8221;
