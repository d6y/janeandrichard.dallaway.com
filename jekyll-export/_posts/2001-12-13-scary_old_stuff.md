[Google](http://www.google.com/) have made the last 20 years of Usenet news available of searching.

[Searching on your own name](http://groups.google.com/groups) brings back some interesting things. In my case, things I&#8217;d forgotten about. It seems that in 1989 I was posting in comp.ai.neural-nets. In the first half of the 1990s I was spending a lot of time writing LaTeX macros, by 1995 I was worried about Pro*C and Oracle, but by 1996 everything was web related.

The first result from google for me is a posting to rec.pets. I had no idea what it was about, but a [bit of digging](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:brian%40ucselx.sdsu.edu&hl=en&rnum=6&selm=1990Nov12.190542.11114%40ucselx.sdsu.edu) revealed that some one in San Diego was offering to digitize pictures of a cat for me. In the days when scanners were not commonplace.

There&#8217;s a nice write up about [what google have dug up](http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html) from the archive.
