Last Monday (9th) I thought I could finally say goodbye to the cough that had been plaguing me for the past few weeks. Hurrah! All was great until Thursday, when I started coughing again. By Friday I had a temperature of 101.5 and by Saturday I was a snot monster with a nasty cough again. I&#8217;m on the road to recovery again and have just been to see the Doctor and got some penicillin to shift the cough away from my chest. So, one week before Christmas and I&#8217;m on antibiotics. Lovely! Oh, and Christmas is running late in our house cos I spent all the weekend in bed &#8211; so no Christmas tree yet, (in fact our wonderful idea of going and digging our own at [Wilderness Wood](http://www.wildernesswood.co.uk/christmastrees.htm) has bitten the dust as we&#8217;re going to have so many other things to do this weekend :-()
