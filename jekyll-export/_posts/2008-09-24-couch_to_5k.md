I&#8217;ve prepared an email with these details in a couple of times now, so I thought I&#8217;d put it on here for easy reference.

I started jogging 9 or so weeks ago, and decided to follow the [Couch to 5K programme from Cool Running](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml). With the exception of the week when I was on holiday, I&#8217;ve ran 3 days per week and this morning completed Week 8 Day 2. I ran for 28 minutes non-stop, and covered [4.1 kilometers](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2287523).

One of the main helpers in my ability to do this have been the podcasts &#8211; I don&#8217;t have a watch that works at the moment, and the thought of pulling my phone out and second watching to work out when I should run and when I should walk (at least in the early weeks) held no appeal &#8211; so I&#8217;ve been using [Robert Ullrey&#8217;s C25K Podcasts](http://www.ullreys.com/robert/Podcasts/page4/files/category-7.html).

I&#8217;ve been using twitter to record my progress since Week 3 for both distance and feelings &#8211; you can [take a look here](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23c25k+janefoth).

By the end of next week I should be able to run for 30 minutes without stopping, and should be approaching that 5K mark. Now I just have to find a 5K race to compete in &#8211; the only runs I can find at the moment seem to be 8K or 10K which is somewhat out of my reach at the moment.
