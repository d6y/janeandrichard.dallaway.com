Still playing with the new camera! This time with a night shot &#8211; something I&#8217;ve never been able to do before as I&#8217;ve never had a camera which you can adjust the shutter time on. So, this was taken at the camera&#8217;s maximum shutter time of 15 seconds (which I discovered is too long a bright moon!). The only adjustment I&#8217;ve made to it is to reduce the red levels a bit as there was more light pollution in the image than in reality. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll play with the other photos I took, and will probably add them to the [gallery](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos). If I get the feeling in my fingers back that is&#8230;
