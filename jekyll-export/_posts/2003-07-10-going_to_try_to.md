I&#8217;m going to try to get a bunch of geek stuff out of my system in one blog&#8230;

I&#8217;ve thought that Apple [ibook](http://www.apple.com/ibook/)s were more-or-less toys which could just about manage to do a bit of word processing and perhaps surfing. I&#8217;ve just finished renting one for a week, to see if I could possibly do my job with a Mac and hopefully shake off my [maclust](http://www.arcterex.net/blog/archives/2003/03/28/maclust.html), and my perceptions have changed. I&#8217;d now happly recommend or work with an ibook: I was able to do some software development on the machine and it was about the same as working on my Pentium III 800Mhz Linux laptop.

Oh, I rented from [Microrent](http://microrent.co.uk) &#8212; if you&#8217;re looking to rent hardware, these people are great. They initially sent me a machine with the wrong version of Mac OS on it. In fact, the machine I was renting (cheapest possible) wasn&#8217;t capable of running the latest and greated OS. So they posted me out the CDs and a nice big chunk of extra memory and talked me through the upgrade. Thanks guys! 

You may have guessed by now, but I&#8217;m hooked. I&#8217;m now the owner of a shiny new [powerbook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index17.html). I&#8217;ve [switched](http://www.apple.com/switch/). 

The other geek thing is that I&#8217;ve written up some notes on my trip to [JavaOne 2003, San Francisco](http://www.dallaway.com/acad/javaone2003/).
