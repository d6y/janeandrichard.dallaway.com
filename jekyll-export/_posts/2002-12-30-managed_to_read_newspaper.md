I managed to read a newspaper over the holiday (gasp) and there
  
was a story about the the results of
   
the [International Rock Paper Scissors Championships](http://www.worldrps.com/champpr2.html). Yup,
   
there&#8217;s a championship out there. Although the World RPS Society talks about &#8220;wits, craft and ingenuity&#8221;,
  
I&#8217;m thinking it boils down to luck and a bit of speed. However, you might want
  
to check out the [advanced guide](http://www.worldrps.com/advanced.html), study the
   
[gambits](http://www.worldrps.com/gambits.html) and maybe look at the [FAQ](http://www.worldrps.com/faq.html) for
  
advice on handling a &#8220;RPS match against a perceived psychic&#8221;.
