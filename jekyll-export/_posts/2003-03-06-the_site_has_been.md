The site has been slow lately, and now we know why&#8230;

I&#8217;m part of a web co-op: we all chip-in to pay for the up-keep of a couple of machines on the web. This site is running on one of the machines. Another of the many sites on the machine is [audioscrobbler.com](http://www.audioscrobbler.com), which has been causing all sorts of problems. I didn&#8217;t know anything about it until I read [a story in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4618663,00.html) today. Interesting stuff, and you&#8217;ll be happy to know it&#8217;s being re-worked to not kill our machines, and will probably be moved somewhere else soon.
