A few months ago I received an email from someone asking if they could see a higher res image of [this photo](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/bonfire_2001/img_0854_640/) to see if they wanted to use it in their magazine. I replied and thought no more about it until today when I got an email saying that it is going to be in the November issue. I haven&#8217;t asked for any money, just a credit and a copy of the [magazine](http://www.saveur.com/) when it&#8217;s published.
