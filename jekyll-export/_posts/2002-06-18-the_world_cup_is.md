The world cup is really starting to get interesting now. 4 of the teams to make it to the quarter finals are not who I expected to see there. So, the quarters line up as:

  * England v Brazil &#8211; Friday 7.30am UK time
  * Germany v USA &#8211; Friday 12.30pm UK time
  * Spain v South Korea &#8211; Saturday 7.30am UK time
  * Senegal v Turkey &#8211; Saturday 12.30pm UK time

There are some interesting and hard to call matches there.
