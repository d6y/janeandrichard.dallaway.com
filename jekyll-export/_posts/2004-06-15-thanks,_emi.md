[Absent Friends](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00014TJUC/richarddallaway) is a great album. As a CD, it&#8217;s terrible. Let me explain&#8230;

Someone, somewhere, in their wisdom has decided that this CD would be &#8220;copy controlled&#8221;. That [means](http://www.members.shaw.ca/cafdir/fakecds.htm) &#8220;on some equipment, for example car CD players, playback problems may be encountered&#8221;. I guess our experience of &#8220;it not working at all&#8221; counts as a &#8220;playback problem&#8221;. 

So: I put the CD in my laptop, ripped the CD, and then wrote a new audio CD, and it works properly in the car. Should I bill EMI for my time and materials? 

This isn&#8217;t particularly new, but it&#8217;s so annoying: I&#8217;ve paid money for the music, why can&#8217;t I be allowed to play it where I want? Anyway&#8230; dumb is the only word I can think of for [this situation](http://www.newolde.com/copy_controlled_cd.htm).
