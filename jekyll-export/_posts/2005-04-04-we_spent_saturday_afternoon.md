We spent Saturday afternoon helping Richard&#8217;s Godson James celebrate his 4th birthday in the [play area](http://www.pub-explorer.com/nhants/photos/ockndoughwellingborough1.jpg) at the [Ock &#8216;n&#8217; Dough](http://www.pub-explorer.com/nhants/pub/ockndoughwellingborough.htm) pub in Wellingborough. We stayed with him and his family overnight, and after the boys had gone to bed, ordered a takeaway from [Deans Caribbean Cuisine](http://www.biznetonline.co.uk/northamptonshire-business-search/deans-caribbean-cuisine.htm) which was really tasty, and a complete change for me as I think the only Caribbean food I&#8217;ve had before has been at the [Notting Hill Carnival](http://www.nottinghillcarnival.org.uk/) many years ago. Now I&#8217;m going to have to investigate the Caribbean food options in Brighton&#8230;
