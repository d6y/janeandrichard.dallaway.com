Last week was [Brighton Science Festival](http://www.brightonscience.com/) and we managed to get to 2 events, although we did attempt a third.

The first one we attempted was the [Cafe Scientifique](http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/) [festival special](http://www.brightonscience.com/programme/cafe.html) on &#8220;The Frog who Croaked Blue: Synesthesia and the Mixing of the Senses&#8221;. But we arrived too late and saw

on the door and so had to make do with a glass of wine in Browns instead&#8230;

Next up was the [Big Space Show](http://www.brightonscience.com/programme/bigspace.html) which consisted of 3 parts. The first was comedienne [Helen Keen](http://www.helenkeen.com/) performing her show [It Is Rocket Science](http://www.thejohnfleming.com/HelenKeen/rocket.html) which was an amusing and quirky look at space, rockets and science.

Next up was [John Zarnecki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zarnecki) talking about Spacecraft I have Known and Loved which was a trip through the various spacecraft that John has worked on, including this one about which he said &#8220;I was with this one longer than my ex-wife&#8221;

The final speaker of the evening was ex-[Astronomer Royal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer_Royal), [Sir Arnold Wolfendale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Wolfendale), on The Origins of the Universe who showed us around various galaxies

All in all, a great evening of learning. 

The last event we attended was [Big Science Saturday](http://www.brightonscience.com/programme/bss.html), a day of science talks and demonstrations.

Our first talk was The Science of Superheroes, a humourous and entertaining look into how the superheroes superpowers could be replicated in the real world. The most amazing of which, at least for me, was invisibility.

Next was Dr [Harry Witchel](http://www.harrywitchel.com/) on The Secret Language of Negotiation which was an interesting introduction to tells and signs with some video footage to back these things up.

Final talk of the day was [Ben Goldacre](http://www.badscience.net/about-dr-ben-goldacre/) who allowed the audience to choose which talk he should do in a &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; style. He was fascinating, passionate and knowledgeable and we&#8217;ve since bought a copy of [his book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Science-Ben-Goldacre/dp/0007240198/?tag=bs0b-21) to peruse in our own time. Highlights for me were the formulas of &#8220;how to <insert verb here> a perfect <insert noun here>&#8221; taken from the [Daily Mail](http://flickr.com/photos/janed/3318252239/in/set-72157614526851095/), the [BBC](http://flickr.com/photos/janed/3318253009/in/set-72157614526851095/) and the [Daily Telegraph](http://flickr.com/photos/janed/3319080054/in/set-72157614526851095/)

If my teachers at school, or at least one in particular, had shown as much passion for his subject as the speakers did I might have managed to leave school with a science qualification. As it was, my Physics teacher announced on the first day of our GCSE course that &#8220;as far as I&#8217;m concerned women are only here to give pleasure to me and give birth to my children and I don&#8217;t see why I should teach you physics&#8221; which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree is a great start to a 2 year course and something that affected my relationship with science. These type of events are a great way for me to reconnect.
