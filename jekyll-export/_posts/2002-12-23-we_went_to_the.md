We went to the &#8220;Burning the Clocks&#8221; celebration here in Brighton last night. It&#8217;s got a very pagan feel to it, even though it was actually only thought up 6 years ago. Two processions of hand made paper clock lanterns, and other imagery set off from the Marina and from the Pavillion meeting up on Marine Parade for a bonfire and fireworks.
