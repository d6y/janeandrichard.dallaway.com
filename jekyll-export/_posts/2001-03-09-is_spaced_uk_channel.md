Is _Spaced_ (UK, Channel 4, 21:30) the best thing that has ever been on tv ever? Why yes, yes it is. And is this because it has no canned laughed? Primarily, yes.

One day I&#8217;ll get round to picking up the first series on DVD. (Available at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005957B/richarddallaway/026-9592763-9397260) or [Blackstar](http://www.blackstar.co.uk/video/item/7000000061464) and lots of other places probably.) 

The [semi-official web site](http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/) is&#8230; busy looking. The [official channel 4 one](http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/spaced/tim_daisy.html) is&#8230; less busy looking.
