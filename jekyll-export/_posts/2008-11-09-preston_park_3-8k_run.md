A few weeks ago I [blogged](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/10/sponsor_me?) about my intention to run the [Brighton Phoenix](http://www.brightonphoenix.org.uk/) Preston Park 3.8k to [raise money](http://www.justgiving.com/janedallaway) for the [Alzheimer&#8217;s Society](http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/). Well, that was today, and I&#8217;m still in one piece. I had some excellent supporters, both family and friends, cheering me around the park and have a [collection of photos](http://flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157608794795145/) taken by my Father In Law and by Richard. So, here&#8217;s the story:

We arrived at Preston Park in time to watch the Men&#8217;s race start at 2pm and my first job was to go and collect my number.

We lined up at 3pm, and were ready to go and I was amongst a lot of club runners &#x2014; I&#8217;d say at least 75% of the participants were associated to some club or other. This was somewhat intimidating.

The race was twice around the park. The majority of the runners had gone off at a speed far quicker than I could keep up with so I let them go, but I think I was still running a bit faster than my usual pace. About three quarters of the way around the circuit, Richard took the following photo.

A futher circuit and I managed to overtake someone just before the final stretch and finished as strongly as I possibly could doing the race in 21 minutes and 50 seconds according to my [GPS trace](http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/workoutdetail/index.do?id=520470). This was a couple of minutes quicker than my practice run a few weeks ago, so I was delighted with myself.

Only the top 32 times were listed today, but apparently the rest of the results will be available on the website during the week. I&#8217;ll post my final time when I know it. I enjoyed the race, well I enjoyed the race being over, and having a good excuse to eat cake :-). The race marshalls around the course were great, and always had a word of encouragement, as did the other supporters around the park, all of which made a big difference.

Finally a big, big thank you to everyone who sponsored me to do this run: you really helped me to keep getting up and out there for a run when the mornings have got colder. As I write this I&#8217;ve raised &#xA3;575. According to the fundraiser&#8217;s pack that the Alzheimer&#8217;s society sent me this helps as follows: 

  * &#xA3;100 pays for eight calls to be answered by our helpline and for a pack of essential information to be sent to people in need of advice
  * &#xA3;500 pays for 65 hours of a support worker&#8217;s time, to help people with dementia understand their diagnosis and help them take part in activities they enjoy

Thanks!
