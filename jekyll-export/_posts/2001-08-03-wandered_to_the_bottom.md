I wandered to the bottom of the road this afternoon to see if things were getting back to normal. They weren&#8217;t. Police are everywhere and a large area is still closed off. And it&#8217;s very quiet. Normally in the day time our road is full of cars parking close to the tube station, and a few buses running up and down the street&#8230;but as everyone is being kept away none of that&#8217;s been happening.
