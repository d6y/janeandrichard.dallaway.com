Us Brits are pretty well famed for liking [toilet humour](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_humour). We visited Rachel and Steve the other weekend, and my Godson, Thomas, who is now 4, is obsessed with the words &#8220;pooh&#8221; and &#8220;wee&#8221; and the funniest thing he can think of is to call someone &#8220;poohy wee-wee head&#8221;. He&#8217;ll shout that out and then disolve into laughter for ages. Strange isn&#8217;t it! The question is tho, is this something that only British children find funny? And if that is the case, what do other Nation&#8217;s children find really, really funny at 4 years old?
