Well, we survived our first snowboarding holiday. We went to [Les Arcs](http://www.lesarcs.com/gb/index.php), France and had a wonderful time.

No real injuries to speak of, a few bruises and blisters, and a lot of aching muscles but other than that it was a real success for us (less so for Simes and Steff who didn&#8217;t get as much snowboarding in as Daisy wouldn&#8217;t settle in the nursery). We concentrated on a couple of runs, and got used to the terrain so that we could learn new aspects rather than spending all our time wondering what we were going to have to deal with next.
