Good week for BBC things, what with [iPlayer not being killed](http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,2003190,00.html), and now &#8230;.[Football Focus](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/football_focus/default.stm) has a video podcast! Sorry, the exclamation mark there probably isn&#8217;t justified, but I like that show.
