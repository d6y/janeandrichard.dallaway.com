Richard and I went and gave blood yesterday at our local session. It was relatively painless, and didn&#8217;t take too long. What percentage of the UK population do you think gives blood? 6%. That&#8217;s all. Poor isn&#8217;t it. No wonder that the National Blood Service have increased the number of donations you can make in a year to 3, they need to rely on their existing donors to meet the demand. You can find out more about giving blood at [blood.co.uk](http://www.blood.co.uk).
