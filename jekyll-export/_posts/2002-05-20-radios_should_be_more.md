Radios should be more like TVs. Dials? A limited number of stored stations labelled &#8220;1&#8221; or &#8220;2&#8221;? Why not have a bit of a screen, a few logos so I can select a channel and go there, rather than scanning for channels? Anyway&#8230; 

I have a thing about needing a radio version of TiVo, and today Jane tempted me with a couple of URLs.

[TiVo for radio&#8217; set for UK launch](http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,437852,00.html) is a story in the Guardian&#8230; but from 14 Feb 2001. Alas [the company](http://www.commandaudio.com/) in the article, sounds like it&#8217;s sort of lost the way. Shame. 

The second, [Bitbop Tuner is TiVo For Radio](http://www.onmagazine.com/on-mag/reviews/article/0,9985,169142-1949,00.html) is from Jul 27, 2001 sounded better, in that it&#8217;s a download for your PC. I go for the download button but the site has an important notice telling me that they&#8217;ve &#8220;discontinued distribution&#8221;.
  
(Amusing moment: The system requirements list &#8220;Minimum Ram: 64MB&#8221;, fine, &#8220;Processor: Absolutely Necessary&#8221; ðŸ™‚ 

So it seems people have tried to make better radios, but there&#8217;s no money in it.
