On my way into work this morning, I took a look at the Metro and a 3 paragraph story caught my eye, the Evening Standard have a version of it [&#8216;Scared&#8217; Eubank on scooter charge](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/dynamic/news/top_story.html?in_review_id=374846&in_review_text_id=320590). Basically, this is the story of how Chris Eubank was charged for riding a [Go-Ped](http://www.goped.com/Home.htm) around the streets of Brighton without a helmet. (A Go-Ped is a motorised scooter about which there are very few laws in the UK). What amused me in the Metro article was the following sentence &#8220;PC Simon Rideout had to start the blue lights flashing and the siren sounding before the ex-boxer pulled over&#8221;. Now, the thought of a police car chasing a Go-Ped is entertaining as Go-Ped&#8217;s aren&#8217;t exactly the quickest method of transport known to man. Chris Eubank received a conditional discharge and had to pay &#163;35 in costs.

The BBC have a couple of related articles, the first in December 1999 [Illegal skateboard driver escapes jail](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_568000/568853.stm) which was about someone who was found guilty of riding a motorised skateboard while disqualified from driving, the second in October 2000 [Police back scooter ban](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_964000/964591.stm) which was about the &#8220;issues&#8221; with the motorised scooters in regards to the UK law.

One of the shops in Ealing [Hippie Heaven](http://www.ealing-online.com/hippie_heaven.htm) has a bigfoot Go-Ped in it&#8217;s window, and they really do look cool. (They&#8217;re not cheap though :-()
