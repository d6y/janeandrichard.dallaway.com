We were in [The Entertainer](http://www.thetoyshop.com/toyshop/index.jsp?bmUID=1259097722938&bmLocale=en_GB) the other day, looking for a travel based board game (which we didn&#8217;t find), when I spotted this:

The game is called [LOGO](http://www.drumondpark.com/logo/) and it seems to be a great way to make sure that children aged 12 years and upwards are indoctrinated as consumers. Oh, and should you be interested, it is retailing for Â£24.99. So, you get to pay to be marketed to. Nice.
