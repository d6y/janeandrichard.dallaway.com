We booked a 4 night break in Prague through [Last Minute](http://www.lastminute.com) and found Prague a great city. Everywhere you turn there are impressive buildings. Every corner you turn there is something to make you stop and think. And the beer is cheap as well ðŸ˜€</a>

We used the [Time Out Prague](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904978134/richarddallaway) and the [Prague popout map](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1845875184/202-2720243-4131820?v=glance&n=266239/richarddallaway/) to find our way around.

We did the usual touristy things, checking out the castle, the Charles Bridge, the old town, the new town. We only visited one museum which was the [Museum of Communism](http://www.muzeumkomunismu.cz/) but there were plenty of others we could have seen.
  
It would be possible to spend a 2 night break in Prague and see most of the sights, we were fortunate enough to be able to take it easy and have a relaxed stay.
  
We stayed at [Andels Hotel](http://www.andelshotel.com/content/en/1.php), which was out of the centre somewhat, but really well connected by a wide range of transport, and the hotel was lovely with good facilities.

All in all, a great trip and a city well worth a vist.
