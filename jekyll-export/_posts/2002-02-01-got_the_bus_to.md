I got the bus to work today as we&#8217;re going for a pint after work, and it took me longer than it does to cycle. Normally, it takes 15 &#8211; 25 minutes for me to cycle the 3 miles from Brighton to Portslade (depending on the weather), but today it took me at least 40 minutes from leaving the house to sitting down at my desk. Pah!
