I&#8217;ve been dragging the last bits of life out of my current phone, holding off on a replacement until the
  
[P800](http://www.sonyericsson.com/P800/) becomes available (originally due in September, now January).
  
Anyway, apparently it appears in the new Bond movie, Die Another Day. I&#8217;ve not seen the film yet, but I&#8217;m told the Bad Guy has one.
