Well the move went pretty well. Jeremy lost a pair of shorts &#8211; there was a lovely ripping sound as they split whilst he was bending down to pick up a particularly heavy cabinet. Oops. So now we&#8217;re established in our new office. We overlook an MOT garage so it&#8217;s not exactly peaceful, and the smell from the cafe down the corridor is a bit hunger-inducing, but it&#8217;s a nice place to be. Today we got an ISDN line plugged in but because these are serviced offices, we have to go through the NTL switchboard, which means out BT Anytime service no longer works, so we&#8217;re back to paying local calls all the time we&#8217;re connected to the internet. Bah!
