I worked from home yesterday, and got far more done than I would have done in the office (I was writing a functional requirements document and have found myself getting very distracted in the office). I finished up for the day at 6pm and decided to take a wander down to the sea front with the camera to watch the sunset. It was really pleasant just wandering along, watching the lads play on the basketball court, and seeing a load of kite surfers a little way further up the coast. I don&#8217;t get the chance to see Brighton in the daylight during the week very often so I felt I had to make the most of it.
