[Brighton Festival](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/festival/) kicks off about&#8230; now. So many things on, but we&#8217;ve only just started to get tickets. That&#8217;s because the [festival web site](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/) is horrid. It&#8217;s not just the usability of the site and the missing features (let me get this straight: I _can&#8217;t_ book on-line? Hellllooo?), but it&#8217;s that it doesn&#8217;t have all the information that the printed guide has. So we waited until the printed guide came out, and we&#8217;re using that. Shame.
