One of the podcasts I regularly listen to is [Woman&#8217;s Hour](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/), and yesterday&#8217;s was about [Only Children as adults](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/02/2006_35_wed.shtml) which, as an only child, was interesting for me. I&#8217;d never really given much thought to the concept of there being &#8220;particular challenges facing only children&#8221;, but I guess there are. Thinking about it, I don&#8217;t know that many only children, so I guess we&#8217;re still rare, although my Mum is an only child too.

Since listening to the podcast I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of googling on only children and have found a [mailing list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/beinganonly/), a [magazine](http://www.onlychild.com/home.html), a [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Only-Child/dp/0285631489/sr=8-1/qid=1157055422/ref=pd_ka_1/026-5059050-1325254?ie=UTF8&s=gateway) as well as the [conference](http://www.onlychild.icom43.net/program.html) mentioned on the podcast. I&#8217;d never even though about there being support networks for only children, but I guess there are support networks for everything else ðŸ™‚
