When I was in the US a few weeks back, I took my laptop and as a result managed to mostly avoid watching US TV. What I found myself doing was watching a bunch of video podcasts that I had somehow accumulated. Things like [Mobuzz](http://www.mobuzz.com/), [Snowfix](http://www.snowfix.tv/) and the currently off-form [Tikibar TV](http://www.tikibartv.com), etc etc [etc](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewGenre?id=26). Although I&#8217;ve been subscribed to a bunch of these for a while, what&#8217;s creeped up on me is the quality: they&#8217;re really good! (I shouldn&#8217;t be so surprised). And there&#8217;s lots of them.

So when people talk about the nature of TV changing, I&#8217;m starting to think they might be right.
