We grabbed the [last chance](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1806771,00.html) to go and see [Jerry Springer the opera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Springer_the_opera) at Brighton Dome the other week. We didn&#8217;t see it on TV, and so couldn&#8217;t appreciate the outrage it caused in relation to the [language and &#8220;religious themes&#8221;](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4159217.stm).

Apparently a third of venues dropped the show after being threatened with prosecution. Which is very silly. The show does contain strong language, and it does have religious content in the second half, but it&#8217;s not something you&#8217;d want to get worked up about. It&#8217;s funny, but as with all things, not to everyone&#8217;s taste. 

The show itself is worth seeing: performances were excellent, the idea was superb, and the writing contained some moments of genius. The Hollywood-style dance routine by the Ku Klux Klan is going to stick in [my memory](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,946543,00.html) for some time, I suspect.
