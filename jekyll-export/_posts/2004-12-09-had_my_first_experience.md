I had my first experience of opera on Sunday evening. Richard took me to see [Aida](http://www.metopera.org/synopses/aida.html) at the [Brighton Centre](http://www.brightoncentre.co.uk/) performed by the [Chisinau National Opera](http://www.mvdaily.com/articles/2002/10/muntean1.htm). I enjoyed [it](http://www.theatre-wales.co.uk/reviews/reviews_details.asp?reviewID=889), although I hadn&#8217;t prepared myself for it being quite so long&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure if opera is really my thing, but the sound of an orchestra takes some beating and so I suspect we&#8217;ll head off to a classical concert at some point.
