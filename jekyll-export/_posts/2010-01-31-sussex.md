Whilst I was [walking along the South Downs](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/31-Jan-10-12_11-stanmer.kml) with Richard and Skitters early today, I was struck by how much I love living in Sussex, and how much more I&#8217;ve seen of it in the past year.

We first moved here in 2001, and at that time our priorities were being close to a train station, and being in the centre of town &#8211; both because, at that time, I was commuting into Farringdon on a daily basis. Over the first year we made excursions out and about, especially when we had visitors. 

Over the next few years, we did quite a bit of mountain biking, and discovered lots of lovely trails which could be accessed either directly from the centre of town, or by getting on a train.

These days we load the dog and ourselves into the car (mostly) and head off in search of views. Over the past 9 months, we&#8217;ve visited many areas of Sussex, from Camber, to Friston Forest and the Seven Sisters, to the River Adur. This weekend has seen us walk around Devil&#8217;s Dyke and around Stanmer &#8211; both accessible by public transport. This afternoon I lost myself in the hills, and dales, the valleys, the trees, and was happy.
