I&#8217;ve been reading through the [World Snowboarding Guide](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1900916126/richarddallaway) 2004 (online [here](http://www.worldsnowboardguide.com/)) to track down some likely looking places for snowboarding trips next year. Whilst looking for a piste map I came across [SkiMaps.com](http://www.skimaps.com/) which has a good collection of maps. I&#8217;m planning to use it to help me work out a) how many [drag lifts/t-bars](http://skilifts.org/glossary.htm) I&#8217;m going to have to negotiate to get around the mountain and b) how many easy/intermediate runs there are.

And whilst talking about winter holidays, I noticed that there is an interesting article over at [Guardian Winter Sports](http://travel.guardian.co.uk/activities/wintersports) about how to [package your trip online](http://travel.guardian.co.uk/activities/wintersports/story/0,7447,1317867,00.html) which looks to have some interesting links. I picked up a copy of [The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/) at the weekend and their [ski section](http://travel.independent.co.uk/themes/skiing/) had a couple of links to tailor-made trip organisers &#8211; [Ski Independence](http://www.ski-i.com/), [Ski Safari](http://www.skisafari.com/) and [Momentum Ski](http://www.momentum.uk.com/) &#8211; all of which look pretty useful for road trips.
