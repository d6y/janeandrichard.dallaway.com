On Friday we were eating at [Barry&#8217;s At The Tureen](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/international/tureen.html). As well as having great service and great food, Barry turned out to know our next door neighbours, gave us a phone number of someone near by who could help track down some of the history of our house, and for good measure, told us about the [murder that took place in our street this year](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/archive/2001/07/05/NEWS300ZM.html).
