We took the bikes out today again and did the same route we did on the [12th January](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/01/paul_richard_and_took). Today it was a lot less muddy, and was quite mild for February. As we came back along the Undercliff path we stopped and watched 7 or 8 surfers trying to make the most of the waves.
