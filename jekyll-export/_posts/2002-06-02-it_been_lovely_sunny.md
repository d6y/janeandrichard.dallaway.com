It&#8217;s been a lovely, sunny day today and it was really great to get a text message from Jeremy to say that [he and Kirsty](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/Susieleaving2/img_2008_640/) were going to head down to the beach for a barbeque and did we want to join them. We&#8217;d already got some food sorted out as we&#8217;d planned to have one over the weekend anyways, and so we went and joined them and we spent a very pleasant afternoon feasting ourselves on chicken wings, sausages, lamb kebabs etc whilst drinking a couple of beers. Just what Sunday afternoons are made for.
