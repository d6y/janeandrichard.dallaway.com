[Brighton Festival](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/) started today, and the first event was the [Children&#8217;s Parade](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_05_03/). Lots of local schools all decide on themes and make figures and things and parade through Brighton and onto the seafront. It was a really windy day, so some of the larger objects being carried were a bit unruly.
