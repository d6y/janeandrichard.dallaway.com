A few weeks ago Martin told me about the [Brighton Santa Dash](http://www.santadash.com/pages/brighton), a 5km run along the front dressed in a felt santa suit. I&#8217;d been looking for a 5k race after the [Preston Park 3.8k run I did](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/11/preston_park_3.8k_run) in November, and so I signed up to join a handful of other [Madgex Santas](http://justgiving.com/madgexsantadash).

This morning, in the wind and rain, I headed down to Hove sea front, collected my felt suit and hat and got ready to go. Richard came with me for moral support armed with a video camera (which stopped working before the race even started due to water damage) and my camera.

[Seb](http://www.sebleedelisle.com/) joined me at the start line and we ran along together for the majority of the race. There were santa&#8217;s spread out along the sea front, with various bits of santa suits strewn along the promenade &#8211; felt suits don&#8217;t handle the rain too well, and felt trousers don&#8217;t stay up very well. I didn&#8217;t too bad, just losing my belt. The run back from Hove Lagoon to the finish line was a struggle against the wind but I was surrounded by plenty of other soggy santas.

I finished in 33:03, which compares favourably to my 32:35 best practice time, especially considering the conditions, and the fact I was wearing a santa suit and hat. Waiting at the finish line were Richard, [Dave](http://sheepfilms.co.uk/) and [Alex](http://www.alexandtheweb.com) armed with tea and cake &#8211; what an absolute star she is.
