**March 2005**

2 weeks in Canada snowboarding. We did 4 days snowboarding in [Fernie](http://www.fernie.com/), then 2 in [Kimberley](http://www.kimberley.com/index4.html). We then had a day off and drove to [Nelson](http://www.city.nelson.bc.ca/) (which was mostly shut) before catching the [Lake Kootenay Ferry](http://nelson.cps-ecp.org/ferry.htm). We then moved on to [Panorama](http://www.panoramaresort.com/index.htm) and did 2 days snowboarding, with a day off for exploring other resorts, and another day snowboarding. Our final day was spent at [Kicking Horse](http://www.kickinghorseresort.com/winter/) enjoying a powder bowl at the top.
  
A great trip, a beautiful part of the world. Shame about the lack of snow &#8211; Fernie and Panorama look like they&#8217;d be excellent when the snow is better.
