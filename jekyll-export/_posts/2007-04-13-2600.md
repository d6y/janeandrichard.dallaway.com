Here&#8217;s an example of why I like the writing in [2600 magazine](http://www.2600.com/): &#8220;We all love 2600 for its highfalutin articles on port knocking, Caller ID spoofing, Walmart self-checkout hacks, etc., but sometimes we lose sight of the obvious stuff. Sooner or later, the North Koreans or Iranians are going to bomb us. When that happens, how are you going to pay for doughnuts and beer from the 7-11?&#8221; (from the Winter 2007 issue, which goes on to describe how to hide things inside a cut out book).
