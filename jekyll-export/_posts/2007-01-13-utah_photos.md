I&#8217;ve spent the morning producing the photos for our recent [Utah](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157594543067056/) snowboarding trip. There are more snow based photos mainly because this year I bought a new small [Olympus FE-130](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0601/06012604olympus_fe130_140.asp) which is small, compact and cheap enough to not cause too much stress when boarding, there are a lot more on-slope photos than in [recent](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/03/colorado/) [years](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2005/04/canada/).
