As far as I&#8217;m aware 100% of children want to be astronauts (and also, possibly, some slightly older people who should know better). Now they have a [survival guide](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141316586/richarddallaway) from [Emma](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/henstagday/img_2453_640/). As she says: &#8220;Whether you want to join the elite corps of highly trained astronauts, or hand over giant wads of cash to pay for a ticket on a spaceship, you&#8217;ll need to be prepared&#8221;.
