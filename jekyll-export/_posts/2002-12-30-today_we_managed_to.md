Today we managed to get down to take a look at the West Pier and see how much had collapsed. It was a perfect opportunity for me to play with my new camera, and so there are a set of [photos](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2002-12-30/).

I&#8217;ve actually had the time to play with a few of the images, following instructions found on [Eric Jeschke](http://cs.uhh.hawaii.edu/~jeschke/photography/articles/gimp/tutorials.shtml)&#8216;s site specifically for [The Gimp](http://gimp.org/) (the image manipulation application I use) &#8211; and so I&#8217;ve used a different technique for making colour images black and white, and have also added a bit of grain to [one](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2002-12-30/img_3924_bw_grain/). Top Marks to Eric for making really easy to understand instructions.
