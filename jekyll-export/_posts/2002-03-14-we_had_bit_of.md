We had a bit of excitement at lunchtime. We tried out a newly opened coffee place/cafe called [Snosh](http://www.snosh.co.uk). It&#8217;s on Boundary Road (the border of Hove and Portslade) and Susie and I first spotted it last Friday as we wandered up the street. It only opened this Monday, and so today we tried it out, and we were impressed. Finally, we have somewhere worth going to for lunch that doesn&#8217;t involve a drive. Hurrah.
