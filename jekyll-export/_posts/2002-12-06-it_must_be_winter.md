It must be winter because we&#8217;ve mentioned TV twice in todays blogs&#8230;.

The Web Review isn&#8217;t a particularly interesting [web site](http://www.thewebreview.com/) but it makes strangely compelling TV (ITV, no idea when&#8230; probably the very small hours of the morning). They give a quick review of a web site and then chat about it. Sounds dull, but the [presenters](http://www.thewebreview.com/presenter.htm) make it something I&#8217;d watch again.
