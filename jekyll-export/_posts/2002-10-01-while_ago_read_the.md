A while ago I read the [Longitude](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857025717/richarddallaway) book. Maybe I read it too quickly, or missed a bit, but I never really understood how
  
you&#8217;d navigate in the 1700s using the stars and trying to figure out the time in London. Anyway, the other night I was catching up on an episode of [The Ship](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/theship/index.shtml) and it all became clear: if you know it&#8217;s noon where you are right now, and you know the time back in London, you can figure out how far east or west you are. Simple. 

In other TV news, you should have been watching
  
[Scrubs](http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/index.html) and
  
[Six Feet Under](http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/) (the title sequence alone should have won awards &#8230; oh,hold on, it _did_: two [Emmys](http://www.emmys.com/primetime/2002/2002awards.html)).
