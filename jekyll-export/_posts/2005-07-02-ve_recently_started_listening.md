I&#8217;ve recently started listening to podcasts on my [iPod Shuffle](http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/). I&#8217;ve been using iPodder to manage and download them, but the most recent version of iTunes manages them as well.

[iPodder](http://ipodder.sourceforge.net/index.php) &#8211; is a separate application, but integrates with iTunes and creates a new playlist for each feed within iTunes. I can then just open up the playlist, and pick out the ones I want and move them onto the Shuffle.

[iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) &#8211; has a new option for podcasts, and has listed a lot on the music store. Subscribing is easy, and if you have a podcast you like but can&#8217;t find on the store, subscribing is as simple as copying the url into a browser window, and then dragging the url into the podcasts window ([it took a while to work that out](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/06/goodbye_ipodder.html)). iTunes doesn&#8217;t seem to put them into the main library, so instead I pick up the broadcast I want, and copy it onto the Shuffle.

For the moment, I&#8217;ll run with both and see which one works out better for me in the long run.
