Yesterday was [Valentine&#8217;s Day](http://www.historychannel.com/exhibits/valentine/), so we treated ourselves to a meal from [leapingsalmon.com](http://www.leapingsalmon.com/). This is the &#8220;gourmet meal kit&#8221; service: you pick the meal you want, and they send you all the ingredients&#8230; all of them including little tiny bottles of olive oil, little tubs of sugar &#8212; the only ingredient we had to add ourselves was water.

Of course you can buy the ingredients and make a nice meal without help from Leaping Salmon, but it&#8217;s a nice treat to have everything delivered in one package for you to prepare. Believe me, we don&#8217;t usual start a mid-week meal with [tatin of cherry tomatoes](http://www.leapingsalmon.com/productsinfo.asp?Scr=1&MPos=11&PR_ID=125&mscssid=&meal_type=3&BusID=&RefLink=) (mmm&#8230; yummy). We also had the [roast salmon with nori and pine nut crust](http://www.leapingsalmon.com/productsinfo.asp?Scr=1&MPos=3&PR_ID=056&mscssid=&meal_type=1&BusID=&RefLink=). All very tasty, easy and quick to make.

It even ended up looking like it was supposed to look (more or less):

The only downside is&#8230; what to do with all the packaging.
