I&#8217;m working on a new database project at the moment which is dealing with a lot of number manipulations. To make sure we can test all the stored procedures/functions I started writing some test harness code. Then I did a quick google, and thanks to [Robert Hurlbut&#8217;s .Net Blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/posts/22537.aspx#30969) I found a [TSQL Unit Testing Framework](http://tsqlunit.sourceforge.net/index.html). My first 2 test procedures did what I expected &#8211; yay!
