My folks have been visiting for the last few days, and so we&#8217;ve had a bit more opportunity to explore Brighton and Sussex. It&#8217;s been great, and the weather has been really kind to us &#8211; cold but sunny, and only one day of rain (and we&#8217;d planned to be indoors that day anyway &#8211; we went around the Pavilion which is a really interesting place). See [the photos](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/FothergillVisitNov2001/).

We also went to a new restaurant on Saturday evening &#8211; Lucy&#8217;s Restaurant on the sea front, between Alfresco and the new children&#8217;s playground. This is a fairly small place, and they&#8217;ve just decided to open up in the evenings Thursday to Sunday. The menu isn&#8217;t huge, but there is a good choice, and I heartily recommend the lamb cutlets &#8211; they were fantastic. It&#8217;s a nice relaxed place, and we&#8217;ll be going back again soon.
