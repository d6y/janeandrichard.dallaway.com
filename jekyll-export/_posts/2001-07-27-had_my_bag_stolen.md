I had my bag stolen from the Hogshead pub in Cowcross street, near Farringdon station in London yesterday. It&#8217;s a really nasty experience and I lost everything, cash, cards, tube pass, keys, phone, [visor](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/visor.xml), [mp3 player](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/soundsgood.xml), [headphones](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/headphones.xml), [eyemodule](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/eyemodule.xml). The most annoying thing is that the pub has CCTV, and it has a camera which was pointing directly at where I was, but they don&#8217;t bother to put tapes in and record the pictures. They just had the picture of the bar visible so they could see how busy they were. The police weren&#8217;t very impressed when they found that out. They recommend not bothering to drink there again, as there are many other pubs to choose from.

So, I guess in the short term I&#8217;ll be fishing the old PalmPilot Professional out of the loft again to make my journeys to work less boring, at least with an electronic gadget I can catch up on the news, read emails etc. I&#8217;ve got a bit used to the 8MB of storage I get on the visor so shrinking back to 1MB might be a bit tricky. But, I guess I&#8217;m in the market for a new PDA, not sure which to go for so I&#8217;m planning to do some research and find out which are the best to be had now.
