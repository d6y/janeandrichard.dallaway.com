We&#8217;re back from a trip to New York. I&#8217;ll just mention one thing before I forget: the crossing signs on the streets spoke (not so unusual in itself) but it was more like a song. We got &#8220;Wait&#8230; Wait&#8230;. Wait&#8230;. Sixth Avenue! Walk sign is on to cross Sixth Avenue. Sixth Avenue! Walk sign is on &#8230;&#8221;. There&#8217;s something about the pause between &#8220;cross&#8221; and &#8220;Sixth Avenue&#8221; that made it flow so well. There&#8217;s an example [WAV sample of something similar](http://www.walkinginfo.org/aps/audio/9custom1.wav) you can listen to, but it&#8217;s much too flat &#8211; not the same at all. We should have recorded it.
