Me, Jono and Jane needed to be near Pembrey on Sunday (Jane will tell you why). The few places we tried were busy, and we ended up spending Saturday night at [Hotel Miramar](http://www.a1tourism.com/uk/hotelmir.html) in Llanelli. I just want to say that this area of Wales needs much more competition in the hotel market.

1. The only accommodation they could offer was an apartment: &#8220;Adjacent to the Hotel Miramar we have three apartments decorated and furnished to a high standard with all facilities&#8221;. These may have been high standards circa 1972, they may have been acceptable as student accommodation, but in truth it was depressing. I can&#8217;t even say &#8220;it had character&#8221;. I think it was all the stains that did it for me. It&#8217;s sort of sad, but I would have much rather stayed at a motorway motel or similar. It would have been about the same price: &#163;75 for the three of us.

2. On the plus side, the staff were helpful. The bathroom was on it&#8217;s way towards small pool before they fixed the leak, and we were in danger of freezing before the heating was fixed (yeah, it&#8217;s July, but it was cold). But they fixed them. That&#8217;s good. Or am I lowering my standards?

3. Breakfast wasn&#8217;t bad. But who&#8217;s idea was it to put cheap instant coffee in a coffee pot? It&#8217;s not clever, it&#8217;s not fancy, it doesn&#8217;t taste good. Note to self: always go for tea; it&#8217;s hard to get tea really wrong. One strange thing we saw during breakfast: someone, probably hotel staff, went into the apartments through the backdoor &#8212; leaving the door open &#8212; and out through the front door, leaving that unlocked. Nothing bad happened, but it&#8217;s just disconcerting to watch. 

4. &#8220;The Hotel Miramar is adjacent to Llanelli Railway Station.&#8221; Yeah, this is the big mistake. Anything around a station is not going to be good. We drove around a bit, and we hope we missed the best parts of Llanelli, because if we didn&#8217;t it&#8217;s a depressing place. We didn&#8217;t feel like going out at all, other than to the off license which was literally next door.

A positive note: we had dinner at the Pemberton Arms in Burry Town and that was good pub food with a happy young bloke serving us. We tried to eat at the Poacher&#8217;s Rest in Ferryside, but they didn&#8217;t really want to feed us, and the manager greeted us with a knife in his hand.

In summary, avoid the area, or pay lots in a plush hotel.
