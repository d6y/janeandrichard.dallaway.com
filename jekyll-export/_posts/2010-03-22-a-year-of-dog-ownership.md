One year ago today we [brought Skitters home](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/03/introducing_skitters/) from [Shoreham](http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/rehoming/searchcentres/shoreham/default.aspx) [Dogs Trust](http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/). Over this time we&#8217;ve enjoyed getting to know our 4 legged friend, and building up a relationship with her, and both Richard and I were surprised at just how quickly she became one of the family and how attached we became.

We&#8217;ve had 2 holidays together, one in [Filey, East Yorkshire](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/02/a-week-in-filey-july-2009/) and one in [Gower, Wales](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/02/a-week-in-gower/), both in self-catering dog friendly places. We&#8217;ve [seen more of Sussex](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/01/sussex/) than in the previous 7 years discovering places like [Abbots Wood](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/Recreation.nsf/LUwebdocsBykey/EnglandEastSussexAbbotsWood), [Friston Forest](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/Recreation.nsf/LUWebDocsByKey/EnglandEastSussexNoForestFristonForest), the [Downs Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downs_Link), Lancing beach at low tide etc clocking up in excess of 1000 miles of walking each (and much more than that for Skitters).

I&#8217;ve uploaded [314 photos of her](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/skitters/) to flickr, there are currently [400 photos of her](http://www.flickr.com/people/doggaway/photosof/) and she even has her own camera (thanks to the Goulbourn family who bought it as a Christmas present) which she wears on some of her walks and uploads photos from to [her blog](http://skitters.dallaway.com/).

She has generally shown herself to be a smart, affectionate dog who loves running around, playing fetch and trying to chase after rabbits. She has a problem with people coming to the house, turning into a bit of a guard dog, and never fails to bark at the postman. She also doesn&#8217;t really like bearded chaps (as Danny found out one day). We have spent quite a bit of time training her, but we still have a long way to go &#8211; her recall is good in safe areas, but once she gets a sniff of rabbit, squirrel or small bird there&#8217;s no way she&#8217;s coming back. We also have to work on her door manners and stopping her barking at every new visitor.

As a result of discovering the fun to be had on Brighton beach at a low tide, Richard wrote a twitter feed to show the [low tides](http://twitter.com/brightontide) every day, which is published at 6.30am, just as we&#8217;re thinking of getting up to take Skitters out for her morning walk.

It has been a great year.
