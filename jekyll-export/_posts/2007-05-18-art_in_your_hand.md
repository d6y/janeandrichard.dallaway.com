I read about the [arts council](http://www.artscouncil.org.uk)&#8216;s [Art in your hand](http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/pressnews/press_detail.php?rid=0&sid=&browse=recent&id=838) idea quite a while ago, and applied for one but didn&#8217;t really expect to hear anything. Yesterday, however, my new shiny new travel card wallet arrived. A bit different to the usual dull blue plastic. My [Oyster card](https://sales.oystercard.com/oyster/lul/entry.do) looks quite at home in it.<br clear="all" />
