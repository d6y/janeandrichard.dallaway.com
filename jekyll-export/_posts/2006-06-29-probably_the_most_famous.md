Probably the most famous footballer in the world, [Pele](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pele), is to visit non-league [Garforth Town](http://www.garforthtown.com/content/) because the football ground is being named as &#8220;Estadio Edson Arantes do Nascimento&#8221;. [Simon Clifford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Clifford), the owner of Garforth Town, has contacts with Brazil and other South American footballing nations, which has led to [Socrates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B3crates) coming out of retirement to [play for Garforth Town in 2004](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4025193.stm), and according to the [Yorkshire Post](http://www.yorkshiretoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?sectionid=55&articleid=1595531) both [Carlos Alberto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alberto) and [Luiz Felipe Scolari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_Felipe_Scolari) are due to visit over summer.
