So, further to my last [screen shot of the league table](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/08/hull_city:_briefly_3rd), I thought it was worth a refresh today. We&#8217;ve now equalled Derby&#8217;s total points of last season now and we&#8217;ve only played 6 games. What a great start to the season!
