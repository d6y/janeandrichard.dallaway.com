I think I just heard this phrase on the radio:
  
&#8220;&#8230;meanwhile, over on Radio 4 long wave, lawn mower racing&#8230;&#8221; 

A bit of digging reveals [racemower.co.uk](http://www.racemower.co.uk/), and the fact that today is the British Lawn Mower Racing Association&#8217;s annual 12 hour race. 

&#8220;As the grasshead racers gun their Atcos and Qualcasts round a field in Dorset at a dizzying 35mph, Murray [Walker] is moved to pick up his commentator&#8217;s microphone once more to describe this most spectacular, and democratic, of motor sports. &#8221; 

I&#8217;d better go tune in&#8230;
