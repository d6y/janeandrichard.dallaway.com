We&#8217;ve been working on a new site recently &#8211; it&#8217;s a travel and activity type site, with an associated shop. The gear seems to be pretty good quality so far, and I&#8217;m quite pleased with the functionality we managed to deliver &#8211; all with either open source products, or written with [PHP](http://www.php.net) and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com). So, go and take a look at [Igloo Life](http://www.igloolife.com).
