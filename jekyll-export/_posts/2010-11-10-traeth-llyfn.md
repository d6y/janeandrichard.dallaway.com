We had a week in Pembrokeshire in September, of which more in another post, and whilst we were there I discovered what I think could be my favourite beach (so far!)

It is called Traeth Llyfn, and is between [Porthgain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porthgain) and [Abereiddy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abereiddy) on the [Pembrokeshire coast path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire_Coast_Path). To access the beach you need to walk, and then descend a set of metal steps (which the dog needed to be carried down due to the gaps being too wide for her paws) and once you&#8217;re down there it is a really lovely place to be, and nice and safe for an explorer dog like ours.

We had the beach to ourselves for most of the time we stayed there
