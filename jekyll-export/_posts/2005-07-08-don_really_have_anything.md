I don&#8217;t really have anything to add to [yesterday&#8217;s explosions in London](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2005/london_explosions/default.stm). Neither Richard nor I were anywhere near the city yesterday but instead were safe and well in Sussex. At work we had [Radio 5](http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/) streaming through the internet and [like Jonathan](http://assistantbrighton.blogspot.com/2005/07/bombs-in-london.html) we watched slow-loading news pages arrive through our browsers whilst emailing/texting friends and relatives to ensure their safety. Another day that won&#8217;t be forgotten in a hurry.
