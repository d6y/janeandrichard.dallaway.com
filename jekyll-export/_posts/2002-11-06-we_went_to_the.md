We went to the [Lewes Bonfire](http://www.learntheinternet.co.uk/COGS/bonfire.htm) [again](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/bonfire_2001/) last night. It really is quite an experience, watching while the different Bonfire Societies parade down the middle of the road. The firecrackers that they throw on the street really make a racket when they go off, oh, and if they catch you on the nose, cheek or leg when they don&#8217;t half smart! I haven&#8217;t &#8220;processed&#8221; this years photos yet, but [This is Brighton](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/) have some [here](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/lewes_fireworks/).

One guy died on his way back from the fireworks last night. He was killed when train surfing (climbing through a window and climbing on the roof of the train) when he hit a bridge. Read more [here](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/news/NEWS0.html). Darwin awards anyone?
