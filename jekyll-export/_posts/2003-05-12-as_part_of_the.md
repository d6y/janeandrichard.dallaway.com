As part of the Streets of Brighton section of the [Festival](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/), we went to 2 of the free events last Thursday evening. The first was [The Constant Soldier](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/index.asp?id=563), and the second was [Sister Sister](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/index.asp?id=546).

The Constant Soldier was a bit beyond us, as we didn&#8217;t know the original Andersen story but it seemed to be quite well thought out, although I thought that the turn out was a bit poor.

Sister Sister was really well put together, and very enjoyable (although very hard to take photos of as they didn&#8217;t stand still very often). It was a mixture of trapeze, video installation and anarchic circus and a decent crowd turned up to support them.
