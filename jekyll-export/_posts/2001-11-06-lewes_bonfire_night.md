&#8221;

We went to Lewes on Monday night to experience the [Bonfire Night](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/lewes_fireworks/) festivities. There are 5 different Bonfire Societies who make effigys, costumes and loads and loads of flaming torches. There are 31 different street processions &#8211; we saw 5 or so of them, and they were fairly impressive. We watched the Waterloo bonfire start and then headed off back towards the car and found an excellent view across the 5 different firework displays. We didn&#8217;t really have a plan, but just wandered around. Next year, we&#8217;ll probably organise ourselves a bit better and learn from this year.
