I [blogged](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/06/kites_used_to_build_the_pyramids?) a week or so ago about Kites being used to lift an obelisk. The [National Geographic](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/06/0628_caltechobelisk.html) website now has an article about it, and also a photo of the lift in progress.
