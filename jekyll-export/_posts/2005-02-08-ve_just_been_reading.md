I&#8217;ve just been reading a [thread on Gone Boarding](http://www.goneboarding.co.uk/Forum/ShowThread.aspx?ThreadID=12531) about a [study about helmet wearing for boarders and skiers](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/reprint/330/7486/281). I don&#8217;t have a helmet at the moment for snowboarding, but yet I do wear one when I&#8217;m on my mountain bike, both on and off road. Somehow that doesn&#8217;t seem to make much sense, I&#8217;ve banged my head more often snowboarding than I have on the bike. Maybe that&#8217;s another thing I should add to my shopping list next time I&#8217;m at a resort.
