Previously on &#8220;Jane on the radio&#8221;&#8230; we&#8217;d discovered [a recording of Jane&#8217;s christening](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/12/jane_on_the_radio/). Now we have [the photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/sets/72157626672315422/) to go with it:

The [write-up in Ariel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/5698396023/), the BBC internal magazine, said:

> Baby Jane made a name for herself last month when her Christening service was broadcast on [Radio Humberside](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_Humberside).  The Christening, at St Nicholas Parish Church, Hull, coincided with the time of Humberside&#8217;s regular Sunday morning _United Acts of Worship_.
  
> It came as a happy surprise when the Vicar told Humberside staff: &#8220;We are doing a Christening this morning. Do you mind?&#8221; Humberside Station Manager John Cordeaux was delighted. And baby Jane Fothergill was the ideal &#8216;star&#8217; — well behaved, but making just enough baby noises to make her presence felt.
