And in other news, the [Center Parcs](http://www.centerparcs.com/) complex that we are meant to be going to for a long weekend in June has been on fire today. It sounds quite serious. From the [BBC report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/england/newsid_1910000/1910618.stm)

_Graham Smith, assistant chief fire officer for Suffolk, said: &#8220;It&#8217;s a particularly difficult fire to tackle due to the early collapse of some of the structure which has created dangerous conditions for the firefighters.&#8221;_

Not sure I like the &#8220;early collapse of some of the structure&#8221; bit at all&#8230;
