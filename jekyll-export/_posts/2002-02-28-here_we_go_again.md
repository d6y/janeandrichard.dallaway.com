According to the [BBC News story](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/football/teams/h/hull_city/newsid_1845000/1845418.stm) Billy Russell will be the caretaker manager until a permanent replacement can be found. Read the full statement on the [Official Hull City website](http://www.hullcityafc.net/today/view/breaking_news_detail/0,,10338~181152,00.html).
