For our [Christmas cards](http://uk.moo.com/products/christmas-cards.html) this year we didn&#8217;t [force the dog to be a model again](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/12/), but took advantage of opportunities when they arose through the year. So, one of the designs featured Skitters wearing her Christmas collar, taken in the snow of last December

whilst the other was a photograph of a Santa painted on the Bondhi beach graffiti wall which we spotted whilst we were [in Sydney](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/08/2-weeks-in-sydney/) last January

We&#8217;ve now done our travelling, and delivered all of the presents that need more than a short walk, so can start this relaxing thing that I&#8217;ve heard so much about. 

Have a wonderful festive season
