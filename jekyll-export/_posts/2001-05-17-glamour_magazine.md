A new magazine was launched in the UK a couple of
   
months ago. No big deal, new magazines are launched all the time. What&#8217;s different about it is it&#8217;s size. Instead of the usual size it&#8217;s about A5 &#8211; only slightly wider than a book. This is a fantastic idea in my opinion. It makes them even more transportable on tubes, trains, planes etc. I read the April edition (I think) and I have to admit that it was &#8220;just another women&#8217;s magazine&#8221; but, if I was looking for something to read on my way to work or similar it would probably be one of my first choices.
