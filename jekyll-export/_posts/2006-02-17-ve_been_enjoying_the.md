I&#8217;ve been enjoying the BBC coverage of the [Winter Olympics](http://www.torino2006.org/ENG/OlympicGames/home/index.html), and especially enjoyed the [mens snowboard cross](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/winter_sports/4545292.stm) event yesterday. It was great to see this event make it onto the olympic stage as its so different to most of the olympic events, and is an excellent sport to watch from the sofa. I wouldn&#8217;t even manage to get out of the gates, so maybe I should go and do some more practice ðŸ™‚
