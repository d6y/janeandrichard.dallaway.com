I was looking to redeem some of my [nectar](http://www.nectar.com/NectarHome.nectar) points earlier, and so attempted to log on. I couldn&#8217;t remember my password, but I know both my card number and my email address. Their [Forgotten your password](http://www.nectar.com/login/firstforgotPassword.nectar) page allows you to enter either email address or password.

I chose to enter my email address, as it saved wandering off to find the piece of plastic.

So despite the fact that it says twice to enter either email address or nectar card number, they don&#8217;t allow you to enter email address on this form. You&#8217;ve got to enter your nectar card number. So, I&#8217;ve had to go and find that plastic card anyway. An example of poor user experience.
