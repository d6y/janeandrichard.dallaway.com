So, it looks like war will have started before the end of the week. I remember the [start of the Gulf war](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1118611.stm). I was at university, in my first year and one of the lads, Phil, ran along the corridor of our halls of residence knocking on our doors and telling us that we were at war. I remember turning on my tv and watching the news coverage.

This time, I think, I&#8217;m much more aware. I don&#8217;t remember the ramp up to war last time, but this seems to have been going on for months now. It&#8217;s also interesting to see the number of people (celebrities, politicans and everyday folks) who are taking what seems like 101 different stands on the subject. Some are pro-war, some are anti-war, some are anti-Saddam, some are anti-sanctions etc.

I was looking at some of the news coverage on BBC News yesterday, and I was shocked to see quite how much Tony Blair seems to have aged in the last 6 weeks or so. He looks very [drawn](http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/38966000/jpg/_38966415_tonyb_ap203.jpg) now, and has started to resemble [Richard E Grant](http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hc&id=1800019915&cf=pg&photoid=227396&intl=us)! Compare that to how he looked when he first [became Prime Minister](http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/525000/images/_527258_tonyandcherie97_150.jpg).
