Just a quick pre Christmas post to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

2009 was the year that we finally got a dog, the lovely [Skitters](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/tag/skitters/) joined us 9 months ago from Shoreham [Dogs Trust](http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/). Obviously, we think she&#8217;s the cutest dog in the country, and that everyone should own a picture of her. 

So, we armed her with a plush santa toy (which miraculously is still in one piece), covered the sofa in a sheet, and I practiced my [off-camera flash techniques](http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2009/11/flash-improve-your-lighting-techniques.html) learnt at my [Garage Studios](http://garage-studios.co.uk/) [Flash](http://garage-studios.co.uk/courses/flash) course to produce 4 photos that we were happy with. A quick upload to the lovely people at [Moo](http://uk.moo.com/en/) and a few days later I collected 75 lovely Christmas cards from the post office. 

This photo, the composite, was used as the rear image, with the front showing a full size version of one of the [individual photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622745622821/). So, if you got one of these cards, I hope you liked it, if you didn&#8217;t, well, erm, sorry about that&#8230;
