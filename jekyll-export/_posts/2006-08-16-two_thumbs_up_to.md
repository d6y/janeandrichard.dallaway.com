Two thumbs up to [Dave](http://davehodg.blogspot.com/) for suggesting we go and listen to [Pauline Taylor](http://www.myspace.com/paulinetaylor) at the Western Front. As it turns out we weren&#8217;t able to hang around to hear her set, but we did catch [Ferris](http://www.myspace.com/ferrishome) (myspace: Other / Folk Rock / Alternative). I look forward to clicking &#8220;buy&#8221; on their music in iTunes at some point. 

So we now know we have a great little [live music venue](http://www.badgermusic.co.uk/) two minutes from our front door.
