It&#8217;s sometimes interesting to see what people read on the tube in a morning. This morning there were 2 people reading Metro (the free London newspaper), one guy reading one of the broadsheet newspapers, a guy reading [Nick Hornby&#8217;s &#8220;About a Boy&#8221;](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140293450/richarddallaway), a guy reading a biography about Tony Hancock ([When the wind changed, The life and death of Tony Hancock by Cliff Goodwin](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/009960941X/richarddallaway)), one reading a Java book ([J2EE Technology in Practice](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201746220/richarddallaway)) and one lady filling in London Underground refund forms (2 or 3 of them).

Every now and again, there are some more unusual books to be seen, like the Tony Hancock example this morning. A few months ago now I saw a guy reading &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221; by Adolf Hitler. It was a big book, much bigger than I&#8217;d expected (694 pages according to [amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0395083621/richarddallaway)). I knew the book existed &#8211; we&#8217;d learnt about it at school in history (that upset my Dad as what I called history, he remembered), but I&#8217;d expected it to be some short propaganda booklet, not a 3inch think paperback.
