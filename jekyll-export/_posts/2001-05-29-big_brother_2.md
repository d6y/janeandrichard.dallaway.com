Well, Big Brother started again in the UK on Friday, and I&#8217;m kind of hooked again. Not sufficiently hooked so that I watch it on E4 for 20 hours a day or whatever, but enough to check the [site](http://www.bigbrother.terra.com/frameset.html) out from time to time. I only got interested in the first Big Brother at the time when Nasty Nick got kicked out, and I think I was a bit spoilt as that was way more interesting than the current programmes are. However, it is early days yet. It is very obvious (well to me anyway) that Channel 4 are definitely trying to spice things up a bit with this series, building a &#8220;den&#8221;, putting in a &#8220;table dancer&#8221; etc and I guess only time will tell whether anything happens or not.
