In 2006 [we visited Bletchly Park](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/09/geek_heritage), and I really recommend you head out there sometime. In fact, go **soon**, because we found out at [the Cafe Sci talk](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/297388/) that they have three years left of funding. Then&#8230; it&#8217;s gone. 

Yesterday I received [a press release](http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/516816) which contained some worrying images of building decay. But there&#8217;s something you can do&#8230;

  * You can sign the petition lobbying the Prime Minister to act to help preserve Bletchley Park: <http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/BletchleyPark/>.
  * You can visit. We were lucky and went [on a special day](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622636780133/), so check out [the list of events](http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/calendar/futureEvents.rhtm?cat=special). The train station is [more-or-less across the road](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=8958416784856176403,51.995504,-0.737427&saddr=Unknown+road+%4051.995504,+-0.737427&daddr=51.996851,-0.738337&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=17&sll=51.996349,-0.738026&sspn=0.004003,0.007875&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=17) from Bletchly Park, so it&#8217;s easy to get to. 
  * If you want, you can [donate](http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/shop/changeDonate.rhtm/-1).
