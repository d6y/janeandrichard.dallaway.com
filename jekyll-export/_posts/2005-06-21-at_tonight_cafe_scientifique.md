At tonight&#8217;s [Cafe Scientifique](http://www.cafe-scientifique-brighton.org.uk/) [Daniel Nettle](http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/) talked about happiness. Not in a hippy self-help way, but in a psychological, physiological, sociological, behavioural way.
  
Happiness, though tricky to measure, hasn&#8217;t increased since the &#8217;50s despite the over-wehelming increase in wealth and health. There seems to be a distinction between wanting things and liking things, supported by the difference in our brains response to addictive drugs such as cocaine (want) and non-adictive pleasure drugs like ecstasy (like). 

We learned a new concept tonight, that of [Flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). We&#8217;re probably flow junkies, and not-coincidently (?) our snowboard bindings are made by a company called [Flow](http://www.flow.com/). We also learned Switzerland (or possibly Norway) is the happiest country. Either way, they both have snow. ðŸ˜€ 

&#8221;

We picked up a copy of [his book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192805584/richarddallaway): it has a happy yellow cover.
