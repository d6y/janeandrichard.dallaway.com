Having recently watched the last (in the series?) of [Adam & Joe Go Tokyo](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/tv/adam_and_joe.shtml), I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that there should be much more Adam and Joe on TV. Mind you, I said pretty much the same thing for [Lee and Herring](http://www.leeandherring.com/)&#8230;

Sure, [not everyone liked it](http://www.shinyshelf.co.uk/article/3/st/652) compared to Adam and Joe&#8217;s [other shows](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2003/02/17/2505.shtml), but it worked for me. I&#8217;ve had a couple of happy seconds playing [Gets!](http://www.andrewandkathleen.com/200305.html) (or Get&#8217;s), and I&#8217;ll be shopping for [Plus-Tech Squeeze Box](http://www.surla.co.uk/bands.asp?band=psb).
