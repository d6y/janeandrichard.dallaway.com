[Brian Clough died today](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3673568.stm). Cloughy was my Grandmother&#8217;s favourite football manager, and always one she respected, and used in a &#8220;Cloughy wouldn&#8217;t have done that&#8221; kind of way. This was of great amusement to my Father as he used this to wind her up on all possible occasions. I still don&#8217;t know why my Gran was a [Nottingham Forest](http://www.nottinghamforest.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Home) fan as she lived in Hull and surrounding areas for all of her life, but she was. One of those things I guess.

There are some great Cloughy quotes at [IOL: Soccer](http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=6&click_id=19&art_id=qw1095691862988S163) &#8211; I guess these are the kind of quotes my Dad liked to remind Gran about.
