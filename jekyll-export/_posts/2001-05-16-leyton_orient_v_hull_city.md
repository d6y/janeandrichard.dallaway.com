Tonight, Hull are playing the 2nd leg of the Play off semi finals at Brisbane Road, London. Hull won the first leg 1-0 so we go into this match with a slight, very slight, advantage. It is the first time Hull have been in the Play Offs and I&#8217;m feeling nervous. I&#8217;m just waiting to start the journey and it&#8217;s a weird feeling. 3000 Hull supporters are expected, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re going to make some noise and support out team the best we can. We&#8217;ve had such a strange season that we&#8217;re all really proud of what the team has achieved whatever the result.

Theoretically a live broadcast from the Radio Humberside commentary should be available [here](http://www.clients.strawberry.co.uk/hullcity/hullcityLIVE.html). C&#8217;mon you Tigers!
