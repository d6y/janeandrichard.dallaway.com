At last [we&#8217;ve moved to Brighton](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622635106207/). Which is all very lovely, but the question is: do we keep [the pelmet](http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/3980750308/)? The previous owners left it in the living room. It&#8217;s very theatrical (it even has a safety curtain). It&#8217;s growing on us. We don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s good or bad. You tell us. (Oh, the picture may look a bit odd, because it&#8217;s stiched together from four photos).
