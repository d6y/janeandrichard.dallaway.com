Productivity thought: I was just writing an email, and I wasn&#8217;t sure about the spelling of a word. It was all over in a few milliseconds, but what I found my fingers doing was to start typing the first few letters of the word and then I pressed CTRL+Space. If you use an [IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/) which has [&#8220;code completion&#8221;](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/help/editing/codecompletion.html), you&#8217;ll will know where I&#8217;m going here&#8230; I was expecting a list of matching words to appear, from which I could pick the one I intended to use. Of course, it didn&#8217;t. I think it&#8217;d be a good feature to have, and would really mean that I never have to learn how to spell.
