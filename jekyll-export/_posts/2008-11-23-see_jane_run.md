It is now 2 weeks since [the race](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/11/preston_park_3.8k_run), and yesterday I wrote a cheque for the cash sponsorship and sent it off to the [Alzheimer&#8217;s Society](http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/). Between the online and offline sponsors, I managed to raise &#xA3;625, a figure I&#8217;m really, really pleased with, so Thank you all again. Not bad for 21 minutes and 42 seconds worth of activity (if you exclude the training that is!) &#8211; it works out at 48p per second.

I suspect I will do another race at some point (so start making your excuses to avoid sponsoring me again now), but at the moment I&#8217;m trying to work out whether to continue my training to get faster at doing a distance I know I can do (5K) or whether to increase my target towards doing a 10K. All advice welcomed.
