I&#8217;ve just had lunch at [Wagamama](http://www.wagamama.com) in [Tunbridge Wells](http://www.visittunbridgewells.com/). It&#8217;s been quite a few years since my last Wagamama experience, and it was as good and tasty as I remember. I can see there being lots of visits to the [Brighton](www.wagamama.com/brighton/) one when it opens later this month.
