We went to see [Moby](http://www.moby.com) last night at the [Brighton Centre](http://www.brightoncentre.co.uk/). He was supported by Lamb (who were a bit lame really &#8211; a strange blend between [Echobelly](http://www.echobelly.com/) and [Bjork](http://www.bjork.com/) but not as good as either &#8211; but they kept telling us that we were a &#8220;wicked audience&#8221;. Which was nice!).

Moby was a surprise. It was a lot punkier and louder than I&#8217;d expected, and there were more real musical instruments &#8211; for some reason I&#8217;d expected a lot of sampled sounds rather than real, live, instruments. He is a pretty manic stage presence, running around the stage and it&#8217;s no wonder that, as Jeremy put it, &#8220;He&#8217;s a skinny thing&#8221;. It was a really good concert, even if it did take quite a while for my ears to recover&#8230; surely a sign that I&#8217;m getting old!?!
