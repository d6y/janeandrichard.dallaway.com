We went to the last of our comedy events for the festival yesterday &#8211; [Paul Merton&#8217;s Silent Clowns](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/silent-clowns.shtml). To be honest, I&#8217;d expected more talking about the films, but what we got was three silent films shown in their entirity. 

Charlie Chaplin in [The Cure](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0007832/), [Laurel and Hardy](http://www.laurel-and-hardy.com/) in [Big Business](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019688/) and Buster Keaton in [Sherlock Jr](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015324/). All of these were accompanied by [Neil Brand](http://www.neilbrand.com/) whose timing was excellent. A great afternoon of entertainment, and a foray into a genre of films I know very little about not to mention a reminder of just how amused I am by Laurel and Hardy.
