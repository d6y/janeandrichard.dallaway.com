I know we go on a lot about [TiVo](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml), but this impressed me&#8230;

We&#8217;d notice a problem where TiVo had confused a bunch of channels: what it thought
  
was BBC4 (say) was actually something like the Parliament channel. This is bad, because when TiVo spots
  
something good to record, it changes to the wrong channel and records something else. Bah. 

On Monday I put a call into TiVO to see what was happening, and they said they&#8217;d look into and probably
  
update our TiVo.
  
Today, they call back.
  
The problem, they&#8217;d figured out, was actually with our set-top box. TiVo was right, the set-top
  
box had the channels confused. Now, I&#8217;d have expected most companies to say &#8220;we&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s
  
somebody else&#8217;s problem, give them (your now out-of-business set-top box manufacturer) a call&#8221;, but the TiVo folk knew what set-top box we have, and gave me the
  
detailed instructions on what to do to fix it.

TiVo: expensive, but in the end, good value.
