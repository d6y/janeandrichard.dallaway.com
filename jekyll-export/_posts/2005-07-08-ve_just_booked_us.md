I&#8217;ve just booked us tickets to see [Stomp in Brighton in October](http://www.brighton-dome.org.uk/events/eventdetails.asp?id=1686). I booked the tickets online, and it took me 4 attempts to buy the damn things&#8230; and then they charged me &#163;1.50 for booking over their &#8220;easy internet booking&#8221;. Worst online purchasing for a LONG time&#8230; Bah!
