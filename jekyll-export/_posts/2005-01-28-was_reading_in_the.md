I was reading in the paper yesterday that The Labour Party are shunning seaside towns. In 2006 they&#8217;re holding their conference in Manchester. I think one guy hit the nail on the head when discussing Blackpool: &#8220;It amazes me that the Labour party, which is a working-class party, doesn&#8217;t want to come to the main working-class resort in the country&#8221;. Yeah, that&#8217;s right, it probably is an image thing. 

&#8220;Unlike other seaside destinations, Brighton has always been popular with delegates, and Labour signed a two-year deal to stage the 2004 and 2005 conferences on the Sussex coast&#8221;.
  
By coincidence 2006 is when the council plan to start the [demolition](http://www.urbanpractitioners.co.uk/brighton/) of the [conference centre](http://www.brighton.co.uk/conferen/centre.htm) (huzzah!). It&#8217;s going to be replaced with a new combined conference and concert venue. So, basically, the same thing only less ugly, presumably. 

From what [I can gather](http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20040417.619343.htm), the area under development is pretty big, and by 2008 could include flats, an extra floor on top of the Churchill Square shopping centre, and the planning options I&#8217;ve seen use words like &#8220;bold&#8221;, &#8220;holistic&#8221; and &#8220;landmark&#8221; &#8212; but they would, wouldn&#8217;t they. 

The new conference/gig venue will be smaller (under 2,000 seats compared to the current 5,500) but &#8220;state of the art&#8221;. Which sounds a little odd until you realize that the [International Ice Arena](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/3206053.stm) at Black Rock, near the marina, will be an 11,000 seat venue. That&#8217;s scheduled to open in 2007, assuming it&#8217;s even started. I&#8217;m guessing the ice part can be covered over, because the prospect of filling an 11,000 seater stadium for some ice skating sounds&#8230; challenging.

It also raises the question of why the council would allow something that size there, but not a 22,000 seater [football stadium in Falmer](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4145237.stm). But that&#8217;s a whole other story.
