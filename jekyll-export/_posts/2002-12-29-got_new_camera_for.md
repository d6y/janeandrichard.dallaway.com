I got a new camera for Christmas (a [Canon G3](http://www.powershot.com/powershot2/g3/)), and I&#8217;ve been busy taking heaps of photos in the last few days &#8211; so here are photos from [Christmas Day](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/christmasday2002/) (including photos of the annual [Brighton sea swimming](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622636621289/)), [Boxing Day](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622760979562/) and the [27th December](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622636945739/)
