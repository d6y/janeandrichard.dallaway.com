I received a letter a month or so ago from a distant cousin who was interested in sharing some of her [family tree](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/tree/index.html) research. This made me realise how long it has been since I did any work on the tree whatsoever. So this evening I decided to try out the [1901 census online](http://www.census.pro.gov.uk/). &#xA3;5 later I&#8217;ve found out addresses for where 2 of my Grandparents were, along with more general information about the [third&#8217;s parents](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/tree/Garnett/index.html). The [fourth&#8217;s family](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/tree/Duffield/index.html), however, remains elusive. It&#8217;s a pretty good service, and seems to be pretty responsive when you consider the amount of people who are in the list.

If anyone happens to be looking for a George S Duffield (aged 6 months) or a John E Duffield (aged 26 years, lodging with the Catley family) in Hull in around 1901 then drop me a line as I have information on these people.

And if anyone happens to know anything about my [Duffield](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/tree/Duffield/index.html)s then please get in touch.
