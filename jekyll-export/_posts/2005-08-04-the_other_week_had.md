The other week I had a business meeting in Manchester, and, to cut a long story short, there&#8217;s no good way to get Brighton to Manchester for a day trip unless you hire a helicopter. I didn&#8217;t hire a helicopter, although I did look into that option. 

Of the sane options &#8212; drive, train, fly &#8212; the cost/time/environment equation for a trip was surprising to me. 

By car [the journey](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?spn=3.577403,7.535522&saddr=bn1+3eh&daddr=m90+1QX&hl=en) would have taken 5hr 30mins (one way), pushed out [about](http://www.climatecare.org/calculator/index.cfm) 0.21 tonnes of CO2 and cost something like &#163;180+ as I would have to had hired a car for this journey the way things panned out. I&#8217;m not willing to drive 11 hours in one day. 

I don&#8217;t know what the CO2 would be like for the train trip (I suspect the lowest) but it was the most expensive at &#163;250 &#8212; I had no idea it was possible to pay so much for a standard one-day return fare. That trip would have taken 4+ hours with two changes and a taxi. Not too bad. 

The option I went for was to fly: including taxis and taxes and trains and waiting around at airports it worked out to &#163;220 and a 3hr 50min door-to-door trip. And less CO2 than the car, at 0.06 tonnes. That&#8217;s the part I can&#8217;t understand. Maybe I&#8217;m not using the calculator correctly, or have I misunderstood the air-travel-will-destory-the-planet reports?
