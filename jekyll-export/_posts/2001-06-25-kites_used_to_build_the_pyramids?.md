I receive mail from the [Alt-Kite](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Alternative-Kite) (Alternative Kite) mailing list on yahoogroups and received an article this morning about the usage of kites to raise an obelisk. One of the enthusiasts, Maureen Clemmons, has posted to the group before. Today&#8217;s article says:

_&#8220;Researchers used a mammoth kite Saturday to set a 6,900-pound obelisk upright, a feat they say demonstrates that ancient Egyptians may have harnessed the wind to move even the most massive of stones. It took two tries but less than five minutes before the reinforced concrete obelisk, which had been prone on the ground, was raised by the tug of a brightly colored parachute modified to fly like a kite in the stiff Mojave Desert wind&#8221;._

Interesting idea eh! Seems that the progress this group have made to date is impressive. The [concept](http://www.archeologee.com/manuscript.html) behind it all makes pretty interesting reading too.
