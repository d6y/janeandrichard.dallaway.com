On Friday we visited Rachel, Steve, Thomas and James in Kettering. The journey up was the first time we used [traffic-i](http://www.traffic-i.com/) &#8212; and it certainly made motorway driving on a Friday night much more predictable. An added bonus: [my phone is backlit](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/p800.xml), making traffic-i usable as a map, without the hassle of rummaging around for a map light.

We ended up at a park on Saturday with Rachel and Thomas and found a cool combined swing, seesaw and roundabout&#8230;.
