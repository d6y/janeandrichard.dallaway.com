One of the programmes that [Tivo](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml) started to record for us as one of its suggestions is [Stargate SG1](http://www.stargate-sg1.com/). We ignored them for a while, generally we don&#8217;t like the whole film spin off thing, but then decided to give it a go one day when there wasn&#8217;t much else worth watching around. And now we&#8217;re hooked. Fortunately for us Tivo finds us lots of them, both from [Channel 4](http://www.channel4.com/) and from [Sky One](http://www1.sky.com/skyone/) (although this does mean that we watch them in a strange order). I&#8217;ve just been taking a look through the [episode guide](http://www.stargate-sg1.com/home/episodes/index.html) and know I&#8217;ve never seen any of Season One. Must look out for that some point. And if you&#8217;ve never seen any Stargate SG1 it&#8217;s kind of a cross between the X-files and Star Trek, and very watchable.
