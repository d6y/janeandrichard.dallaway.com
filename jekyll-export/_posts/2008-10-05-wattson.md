As I write this, there&#8217;s a cup of tea to the right of my keyboard. I have a reasonable idea of how much energy it took to make the tea. When I turned the kettle on, the display on Wattson scrolled up from a resting rate for the house of around 98W to over 2000W. To see those numbers first-hand, and control the numbers with a flip of a switch, is a small awakening. I suspect it&#8217;s common practice when anyone buys an energy measuring device to run around the house turning things on to see what the effect is; and then turn off as much as possible to find the smallest reading possible.

Back to the tea. These days, having had Wattson for a few months, I put a little more care into getting something like the right amount of water in the kettle. But I wonder: now that the novelty of Wattson has worn off, will my behaviour change for the long term? I&#8217;d like to know and keep it in check, and Wattson should help.

There&#8217;s a USB slot on Wattson, and [DIY Kyoto](http://www.diykyoto.com/) supply software, called Holmes, to read the data from the device to show you your usage. The software tries to be funky, but it actually feels like a throwback to me&#8230; but it works. OK, well, ours didn&#8217;t at first, but DIYKyoto were brilliant and fixed the box for us, and we can now pull data from it.

Smashing, eh?

Well&#8230;there&#8217;s a problem with all of this. The data&#8212;or &#8220;my data&#8221; as I like to think of it&#8212;is locked up in an encrypted proprietary database. I&#8217;d love to be able to tell you Wattson is a great device, but the trouble that&#8217;s been gone through to make the data (&#8220;my data&#8221;) hard to get at niggles me. Sure, if you work at it (about 60-90 minutes) you can decrypt the data, but that&#8217;s not really playing the game. And it&#8217;s probably against the license agreement, although I can&#8217;t find it at the moment to check. There&#8217;s talk at the DIY Kyoto web site of adding an export function before the end of the 2008 (or February 2008, depending on which message you read).

Anyway: I&#8217;ll keep an eye on the graphs, and see what happens, but the data needs to be open, even if it&#8217;s via an API. In fact, DIY Kyoto have hinted at online access, and that&#8217;d be a good step. Ideally, there needs to be a direct link from Wattson to the web for a little bit of competitive energy comparison fun. Maybe one day.
