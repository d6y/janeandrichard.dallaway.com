When you work from home a lot, sometimes you need to get out of the house &#8212; even if it&#8217;s just for ten minutes &#8212; to stop yourself going mad. Human interaction. Air. That kind of thing. So, I&#8217;d popped out to the closest coffee shop (yes, it&#8217;s a Starbucks) to get myself a [tall skinny latte](http://www.boundless.org/1999/departments/campus_culture/a0000082.html) and I&#8217;m walking it home up our street. At the bottom of the street there&#8217;s a small white van, and inside there&#8217;s a big happy dog, probably a [Golden Retriever](http://www.dogstore.com/store?fb=0&amp;catID=2076&amp;ft=) or something like that. The kind of dog that &#8216;s inquisitive and doesn&#8217;t seem to know how strong it is: heavy tail wagging away and big paws jumping up onto anything interesting. Outside the car was a man with a coat hanger, trying to angle the coat hanger through an open window to lift up the door latch. Hmmm&#8230;. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d choose to break into a car that has a dog in it. As I got closer I was wondering whether this was a 999 (911) situation, when I overheard the guy talking to the dog: &#8220;this is all your fault that you&#8217;re locked in&#8230;&#8221;. And you can just see it: big dog jumps up at the window, paws slip down onto the lock and&#8230; &#8220;clunk&#8221;.
