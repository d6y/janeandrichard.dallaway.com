Last night we attended the [Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour UK Edition](http://www.banff-uk.com/) show in Brighton. We went last year too, and if I get my way will go every year till they stop bringing it back to Brighton. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to see a variety of sports films on a large screen with a beer in your hand.

The films they show vary depending on your venue, but we got to see:

  * [The Swiss Machine](http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#swiss_machine) &#8211; awesome film, really incredible &#8211; [watch the trailer here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUWBbepsdmY)
  * [Wildwater](http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#wildwater) &#8211; this went on a bit too long for me, but then I&#8217;m not a wildwater fanatic&#8230; So, decide for youself after you&#8217;ve [watched the trailer](http://vimeo.com/12563837)
  * [Eastern Rises](http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#eastern_rises) &#8211; when the lady introducing the video used the phrase &#8220;trust me&#8221; whilst telling us fly fishing was a great subject for a video I feared the worst, but this was a really well put together and, dare I say, interesting film which was utterly engaging &#8211; [watch the trailer](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheBanffCentre#p/u/9/MkgN76QMa3o)
  * Follow Me &#8211; lovely mountain bike footage &#8211; short version of [this film](http://www.anthillfilms.com/content/2009/05/anthill-films-announces-new-movie-follow-me/)
  * [The Longest Way](http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#longest_way) &#8211; a fast and furious look at [photos and occasional video](http://vimeo.com/4636202) as Christop Reharge walks from Beijing to Germany (well part of the way at least)
  * [Azadi Freedom](http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#azadi_freedom) &#8211; part skiing film, part travel documentary about Kashmir, totally absorbing &#8211; [watch trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em6yEvivOKk) (also inline below)
  * [Parking Garage](http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/films/#parking_garage) &#8211; a suitably silly way to end the evening

I think that Azadi Freedom ended up being my favourite of the evening, so I&#8217;ve embedded the trailer here for you to take a look at
  


This was only the 3rd date on [their tour](http://www.banff-uk.com/LOCATIONS-BOOKING(2194534).htm), so there are still plenty of opportunities for you to go and see some of these films, and I&#8217;d recommend it.
