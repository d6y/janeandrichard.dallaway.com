When I ordered the Moby tickets, I decided to save the extra &#xA3;1.25 and collect them from the box office. Only then did I remember that by November I&#8217;ll have changed my name and will have to go through a bit of a performance to prove that the tickets are really mine (Ticketmaster require you to have the purchasers credit card and the reference number as proof). And as I could only collect the tickets on the day, this didn&#8217;t give me much &#8220;proving I&#8217;m really me&#8221; time. So, I&#8217;ve arranged to have them posted to me instead with the hope that this will work out easier.
