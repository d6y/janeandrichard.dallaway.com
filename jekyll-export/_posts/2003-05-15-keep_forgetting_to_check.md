I keep forgetting to check the [BBC Radio 4 Comedy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/) site. They have some great stuff to listen to. Right now I&#8217;m listening to [Laughing at Dingoes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/rams/tue1130.ram), which is Mark Little&#8217;s documentary on Australian humour. [Ross Noble goes Global](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/ross_global.shtml) is something else I like, too. There&#8217;s lots of stuff there, but you need to check weekly because many of the programmes don&#8217;t get archived, presumable because the BBC want to sell them on tape and CD.
