Someone on [BNM](http://www.brightonnewmedia.org) posted a link to [Showing The Game Information Service](http://www.showingthegame.net/). This is being run in Sussex during the World Cup as a pilot scheme, and it sounds like a great idea. An easy way to make sure that you find a pub that is showing a game, and also get an idea on whether the pub has a big screen or just a normal tv.
