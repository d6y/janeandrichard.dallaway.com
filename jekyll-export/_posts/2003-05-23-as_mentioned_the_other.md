As I [mentioned the other day](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2003/05/as_cycled_to_work), the 3rd round of the British Kitesurfing Championships is being held a mile or so up the road. I&#8217;ve just put a report up over at [Igloo Life](http://www.igloolife.com/travel/article.php?ArticleID=21) and will probably have some more pictures to share soon.

Update: there are now some [photos](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_05_23/) up.
