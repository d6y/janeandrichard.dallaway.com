On Friday we headed out to see [Good bye, Lenin!](http://www.good-bye-lenin.de/). A [fine and funny film](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0301357), if you can handle subtitles or speak German, about the fiction a son has to create to keep the [fall of the Berlin Wall](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,967896,00.html) from his mother. I hadn&#8217;t been to the [Duke of York&#8217;s](http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/site/cinemas/Brighton/local.htm) cinema for about 10 years, but I&#8217;ll be back there: the screen felt small (we were at the back of the balcony), but any cinema that&#8217;s licensed and sells cake is on to a winning combination in my books.

Afterwards we needed tasty, quick, cheap food in an uncrowded place. I thought we&#8217;d maybe get two out of those four on a Friday night, but we found them all in one go at Bombay Aloo. It&#8217;s an all-you-can-eat Indian vegetarian buffet. Like other people we&#8217;ve walked past it a few times and wondered what it&#8217;s like: it&#8217;s definitely worth trying. I&#8217;d eat there again without a second thought.
