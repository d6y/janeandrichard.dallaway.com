On Tuesday Richard and I had the pleasure of attending the inaugural [Big Wine Thing](http://geekwinething.org.uk/?p=130). This was an extension of the usual, monthly or thereabouts, [Geek Wine Thing](http://www.geekwinething.org.uk/) but instead of purely wine tasting, this was a food and wine matching event. Again held at [Hotel du Vin in Brighton](http://www.hotelduvin.com/hotels/brighton/hotel-information), and this time led by both [James](http://twitter.com/jamesreina) and Fergus from [Majestic](http://www.majestic.co.uk/) and Pierre, the assistant Somellier.

The evening started with champagne as the participants arrived and settled down ready for an evening of food, wine and education.

Our meal started with a smoked salmon starter served with a lovely, clear, crisp chenin blanc, a Vouvray [Coulée d&#8217;Argent 2008](http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-Vouvray+Coulée+d!APOSArgent/product-is-05338). This was a delightful wine, and another wine which will be finding it&#8217;s way into our fridge over the next few months (to join the [albariño](http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/product-is-14266) and the [gavi di gavi](http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-La+Toledana+-+Gavi+di+Gavi+2009/product-is-13033) from the previous tastings). 

Our main course (for the carnivores) was lamb with dauphinois potatoes served with a vibrant collection of vegetables and served with a Chilean Syrah &#8216;Las Kuras&#8217; 2007 Casa Lapostolle. This met with mixed reviews. It certainly smelled wonderful, really powerful, but the flavour didn&#8217;t quite live up to the bouquet. 

Dessert was the biggest Creme Brulee I&#8217;ve ever encountered (and I managed to scoff the lot) served with a pleasantly surprising dessert wine, [Beaumes de Venise &#8216;Domaine de Coyeux&#8217; 2004](http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/keyword-is-Beaumes+de+Venise/product-is-10278). I say surprising because I&#8217;m not a big dessert wine fan, often finding them too cloying and syrupy. But this was clean and youthful and had a lovely smell of lychees and grapes.

We gained three wine facts from the evening:

  1. Syrah and Shiraz are the same grape, just labelled differently
  2. Many wines are organic but aren&#8217;t labelled as such due to the 10% charge that the soil association charge &#8211; this was the case for the Chilean red
  3. Muscat smells of grapes &#8211; as evidenced by the Beaumes de Venise

All in all another great evening, and certainly an event I&#8217;d be keen to participate in again.
