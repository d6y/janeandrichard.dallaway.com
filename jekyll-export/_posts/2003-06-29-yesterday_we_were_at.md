Yesterday we were at the [Beach Soccer](http://www.ukbeachsoccer.com/) stadium which
  
has been temporarily built in Brighton for the [Kronenbourg Cup](http://62.204.33.220/kc/kc.html)
  
with the help of [400 tonnes of sand](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/archive/2002/06/03/SPORT50ZM.html).

[The rules](http://www.beachsoccer.com/index2.asp?main=rules.htm) are different from the football we&#8217;re used to, in that there are three periods of 12 minutes, a blue card which sends players to the sin bin and there must always be a winner, via extra time or penalties. 

We saw Italy v. Portugal and France v. England (and yes, Eric Cantona was there for the game).

Entertaining stuff, and I&#8217;d certainly go see it again.

I don&#8217;t know what this shark was doing there.
