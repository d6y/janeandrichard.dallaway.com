I&#8217;ve done much more planting than usual this year. Here are the majority of my pots/containers growing wonderfully. The potatoes have been a bit mad.

The bottom right hand corner are my potatoes 9 days before this photo &#8211; the potatoes here are again the bottom right hand of the photo. I&#8217;m really not sure at what point they prevent me being able to see out of the kitchen window. I&#8217;ve marked up this photo with notes explaining what all of the vegetables are.<br clear="all" />
