I tried another recipe from the [Low fat, Low Sugar](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/books/reviews/jane/lowfatlowsugar.xml) cook book today, and made some oatcakes. They taste okay, but I had a real problem rolling them out as almost everytime I put the rolling pin on the mixture, it broke up into pieces. Anyone got any ideas how to prevent this happening? Or happen to have an email address for Rose Elliot (the author)?
