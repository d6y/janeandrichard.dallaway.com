Last weekend I was in [Zurich](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/zurich2006/) with [work](http://www.glass.co.uk/uk/en/). Lots of partying, a bit of business. We were there with 500+ other EurotaxGlass employees, but I have to confess that I didn&#8217;t spend much time with our european colleagues, instead I spent time with some of our Weybridge colleagues that I deal with on a day to day basis, but rarely spend any &#8220;out of office&#8221; time with. It was a really good weekend, with even a bit of sight-seeing thrown in for good measure amongst the drinking and partying.
