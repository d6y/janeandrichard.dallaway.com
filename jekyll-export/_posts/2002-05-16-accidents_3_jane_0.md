What a bad cycling week. What with a small graze on my leg on Sunday when we were out cycling in the downs, and then [Tuesday&#8217;s incident](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/05/nearly_an_accident) &#8211; the result of which was a nasty bruise, I should have known this was all leading up to something worse. This morning, I was cycling in the cycle lane down Preston Street (for those who don&#8217;t know Preston Street is a one way street going up, with a cycle lane going down) on a beautiful sunny morning, when a bloke appears from behind his van with a piece of aluminium sheeting which he slams into my hand. Fortunately, it was a glancing blow and I&#8217;ve only ended up with a small cut on my hand. Could have been a lot worse. Again, he didn&#8217;t seem too concerned about hitting me. I stopped my bike as soon as I could, and found myself being looked after by a lovely crew of builders who found me some plasters and took down the license plate of the van (just in case). Just as I was getting ready to leave, he reappeared with his boss and they both loitered around their van (about 20 metres further up the road) but didn&#8217;t bother to come and check if I was ok.

I pedalled on to work, and then went hunting antiseptics etc at our local [Boots](http://www.wellbeing.com/index.jsp). Paul (guy in the next office) suggested I get some Hydrogen Peroxide as it cleans wounds up well, and it fizzes which is an added bonus, oh and it can [fuel rockets](http://members.aol.com/nicholashl/ukspace/htp/htp.htm)&#8230;. I did, it worked lovely (on the wound, haven&#8217;t tried a rocket yet), and I&#8217;m now sitting having a nice cup of tea (hey, I&#8217;m english, what can I say :-)) and a yummy Chocolate Brownie.
