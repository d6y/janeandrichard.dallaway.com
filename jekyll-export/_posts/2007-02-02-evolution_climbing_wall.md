Last night [Jim](http://www.lacasadelolivar.com/) and I headed off to the [Evolution Indoor Climbing centre](http://www.evolutionclimbingwall.co.uk/evolution.htm) to attend the first of a 3 part [Centre Induction Course](http://www.evolutionclimbingwall.co.uk/adult_courses.htm). The centre is about 5 minutes away from work and opens from 2pm so should be a good after-work activity. It has been nearly 20 years since I last did any climbing, and that was very spasmodic, so this course seemed like a great way to get back into the swing of things. The evening started with us warming up by traversing, then moved on to [knots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowline_hitch) and how to connect yourself/your harness to a rope for climbing before moving on how to [belay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belay). After the theory was done, we put it into practice and spent an hour or so climbing. The last few minutes we spent in the [bouldering area](http://www.evolutionclimbingwall.co.uk/turn_up_and_climb.htm) learning how the grading works. A great evening, looking forward to next weeks course.
