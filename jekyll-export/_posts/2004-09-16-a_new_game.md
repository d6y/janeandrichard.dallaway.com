Inspired by our trip to NY, here&#8217;s a new game you can play anytime you buy anything. The objective of the game is to have the last word when ending a transaction, with a secondary aim of scoring as many points as possible, with a point won each time either you or the shop person says something.

An example of how not to play&#8230; let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve just handed over payment and been given a receipt:

  1. You: Thank you.
  2. Shop person: You&#8217;re welcome.
  3. (you leave the store)

You lose: you didn&#8217;t have the last word, and it&#8217;s a short exchange anyway. Let&#8217;s try again:

  1. You: Thank you.
  2. Shop person: You&#8217;re welcome. 
  3. You: (smile expectantly)
  4. Shop person: Have a nice day.
  5. You: And you have a nice day too.
  6. Shop person: Why thanks.
  7. You: You&#8217;re welcome.
  8. (you leave the store)

Yes! You win, and you score 6 points. Good work.
