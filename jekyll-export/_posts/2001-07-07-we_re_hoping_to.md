We&#8217;re hoping to go the Brighton Kite Festival later on this month, and I was having a look at the event website this morning. One activity of the festival that really caught my eye was [The Bearly Made It Skydive Squad](http://www.brightonkitefest.free-online.co.uk/festival/bmiss.htm). This sounds like lots of fun, and I particularly like the footnote: 
  
_&#8220;BMISS operates an equal opportunities policy: as long as it&#8217;s a cuddly toy, we&#8217;ll parachute it &#8211; monkeys, cows, rabbits&#8230; even pigs might fly! You name it &#8211; we&#8217;ve &#8216;bunged&#8217; it!!_
