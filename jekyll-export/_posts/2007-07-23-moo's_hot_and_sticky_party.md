On Thursday Richard and I headed off into London with a load of other Brighton geeks to [Moo&#8217;s Hot and Sticky Party](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/209918/). Richard managed to attend [another moo party earlier in the year in San Francisco](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2007/05/the_moo_people_put) and after hearing about that there was no way I was missing out on this one. This party was to launch another new product &#8211; [sticker books](http://www.moo.com/products/stickers.php) and we got to take away samples (as well as stick them on each other, moo employees etc etc). 

We met some new faces, put faces to names (especially [Will](http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/about-us/team/document-4-12.php) and [Tom](http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/about-us/team/document-5-12.php) who I&#8217;ve known of for years but weirdly never met) as well as catching up with [someone](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/854805195/in/set-72157600909891917/) I haven&#8217;t seen in over 5 years.

A great party put on by a [company](http://www.moo.com/) who obviously know how to celebrate! I even got 2 photos included in the [moo blog post](http://www.moo.com/blog/2007/07/20/moo-stickers-party-you-all-rock/) about the evening.
