After a lot of press coverage in the last couple of days, it seems that [Hull have appointed Nottingham Forest coach Frank Barlow](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/5124510.stm) as caretaker manager until [Phil Parkinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Parkinson) has his [resignation from Colchester](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/colchester_united/5081416.stm) accepted.
