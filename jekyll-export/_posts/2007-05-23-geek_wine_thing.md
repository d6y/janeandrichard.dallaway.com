Last night we attended the first [Geek Wine Thing](http://yandleblog.com/2007/05/innagural-geek-wine-thing.html) organised by [Danny](http://yandleblog.com/) and held at the [Regency Town House](http://www.rth.org.uk/).

Henry Butler from the [Butlers wine cellar](http://www.butlers-winecellar.co.uk/) led the tasting, and for the cost of a tenner we tasted 8 different Spanish and Portugese wines. As a total novice in the wine tasting world, it was interesting to learn more about how to smell, look at and taste wine. Henry was an excellent and enthusiastic teacher.

The tasting started off very quiet and subdued, but before too many glasses had been consumed we got noisier and noisier.

The [wines we tasted](http://www.flickr.com/photos/11369209@N00/511184267/) were:

**Whites**  
Pares Balta Blanc de Pacs 2006 &#8211; Spain  
Soalheiro Alvarinho 2005 &#8211; Portugal  
Castello D&#8217;Alba 2005 &#8211; Portugal  
Navajas Crianza 2003 &#8211; Spain

**Reds**  
Monte Real Reserva 2000 &#8211; Spain  
Clos Le Fites 2002 &#8211; Spain  
Quinta de la Rosa Tinto 2004 &#8211; Portugal  
Niepoort Redoma 1994 &#8211; Portugal

The white wines were split into unoaked (the first 2) and oaked (the second 2) with one each from Spain and Portugal. As usual I preferred the unoaked &#8211; so another nail in the coffin of oaked wines for me.

Next time, and I hope there will be a next time, I&#8217;ll try and remember to bring a pen to make some notes, as somewhat unsurprisingly I don&#8217;t remember too much beyond the first couple of glasses ðŸ™‚

As usual, my photos from the evening are [all on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157600252536955/).<br clear="all" />
