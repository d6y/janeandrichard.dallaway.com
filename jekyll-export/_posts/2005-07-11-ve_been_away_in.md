I&#8217;ve been away in San Francisco for a [conference](http://blog.spiralarm.com/richard/2005/07/javaone-2005.html). [Pictures](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2005-javaone/) are now available. Things of note&#8230; 

The Virgin Atlantic flight was one of the best I&#8217;ve been on. The on-demand entertainment was good, but the happy helpful staff made the biggest difference. Being able to send SMS from the plane was fun (US$2.50 to send; US$2.00 to receive), although my message was basically &#8220;hey, cool, I&#8217;m 32 thousand feet above Greenland!&#8221;. It seems like the message really did go at that time &#8212; rather than waiting to land, which I would consider to be cheating. Alas, the replies sent never made it to my seat. 

Thank you Loren for taking us to [Foreign Cinema](http://www.foreigncinema.com/) for dinner. My first [Mojito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojito) &#8212; what a fool I&#8217;ve been for missing out on this for so long. 

We stumbled into
  
[Massawa](http://elvispelvis.com/eritrea.htm) on Haight St for some yummy East African food. Must remember for next time. 

And finally&#8230;. Somehow &#8212; and I&#8217;ve no idea how &#8212; Goul got onto the subject of [Fainting Goats](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/faintinggoats.html). In case you can&#8217;t see the video on that link, these look like normal goats, but when they get scared their legs stiffen and they fall over. 

It wasn&#8217;t until I got home that I realized I&#8217;d seen fainting goats [in real life](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/California2003/2003_06_21/175_7549_r1/) on a previous trip to California. I didn&#8217;t see them fall over. I think there might have been a sign saying not to scare them. 

Putting aside the entertainment value, this was being thrown up as a kind of &#8220;you think evolution is good, eh? Well what about these goats?&#8221;. And you have to admit that fainting because your scared isn&#8217;t a great survival strategy for an animal. At least not compared to running away from a predator. The usual answer to these kinds of issues is that the creature has no natural predators, but it&#8217;s different in this case: they&#8217;ve survived because they&#8217;re fun. New scientist put it like this: &#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s odd to think this breed survived as a pet because people made fun of it,&#8217; says Carol Beck of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, whose team found the gene behind the muscle defect&#8221; (These goats may have even made it as &#8220;mutant of the month&#8221; in _Nature Genetics_, but I can&#8217;t check because I don&#8217;t have a subscription.) So there we go: they&#8217;re mutants that are fun to have around. Case closed.
