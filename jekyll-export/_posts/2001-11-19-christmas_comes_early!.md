We&#8217;ve bought each other [Mountain bikes](http://www.ridgebackbikes.co.uk/01adventure/k5.html) for Christmas. We bought them at [The Bike Chain](http://www.yhaadventure.co.uk/html/bike.htm) in Brighton, and have had them now for 10 days or so. Yesterday we went on our first &#8220;proper&#8221; ride on them (previously we&#8217;ve been on a couple of rides along the seafront, but nothing more exciting that). We cycled through Brighton to Stanmer Park, through Stanmer Park and stopped at a little shop/cafe for a refuel of water before heading off along the downs (being passed by lots and lots of cars). We then headed off downhill towards Rottingdean and stopped at the seafront for a little while before cycling along the cliffs until we got back to Brighton. In total just under 15 miles and we arrived home exhausted. It was good fun though, especially the cycling downhill to Rottingdean bit&#8230;
