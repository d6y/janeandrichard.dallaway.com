Well, the office move tale continues. We started looking for a new office in May as we need to move out of the current place by September. We found somewhere we liked, and made an offer, had it accepted and then got the solicitors to deal with it. All that time and we only find out yesterday that their deposit and rent arrangements aren&#8217;t suitable for us. So, we&#8217;ve had a change of plan and are going to be moving into [serviced offices](http://www.maritimehouse.com/) nearby. We don&#8217;t get to be in [Brighton Marina Village](http://www.brighton-marina.co.uk/) any more, but we do get to be near [Woodies Longboard Diner](http://www.woodiesdiner.com/) next to [Ocean Sports](http://www.boardriders.co.uk). ðŸ™‚
