It was pouring with rain when I walked to the tube this morning, and the path I walk along to get to the station was flooded in parts. The &#8220;green&#8221; has turned into a muddy pool.

I decided to try my luck taking a photo with the trusty [eyemodule](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/eyemodule.xml) and produced the following image &#8211; it is in colour, although that is kind of hard to believe.
