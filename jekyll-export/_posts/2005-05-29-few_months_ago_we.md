A few months ago we went to [Indian Summer](http://www.indian-summer.org.uk/is_home_new.html) and tried their Bhel Puri which was lovely. We really enjoyed it and thought we&#8217;d like to try it at home and so bought some puffed rice. All we had to do then was find a [bhel puri recipe](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Bhel+Puri+recipe&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official). After much searching we gave up and headed to [Planet India](http://www.theargus.co.uk/the_argus/the_guide/food__drink/planet_india.html) and tried their Bhel Puri, which was quite different to the Indian Summer version. Today, we headed to the new Taj food store in Western Road and found a ready to eat Sitar Bhel Puri kit, comprising of 10 puris, bhel mix, sev, chilli sauce, garlic sauce and tamarind and date saurce &#8211; this has given me more confidence to narrow down that [recipe](http://www.indianchild.com/Recipes/mini_meals_recipe/bhel_puri_recipe.htm) [search](http://www3.estart.com/stores/media/recipe/bhelpuri.html).
