We had a weekend of food, some new places and one old favourite and as we haven&#8217;t done a food blog for quite some time it&#8217;s review time&#8230;

On Friday evening we had a takeaway from [Noir](http://www.noircaribbean.com/) as [recommended](http://www.theargus.co.uk/whatson/fooddrink/noir/) by [Amanda](http://gastronautuk.blogspot.com/2006/08/noir-caribbean-takeaway-bringing-flava.html). We&#8217;d spotted this a few weeks ago, although according to the owner Denise they&#8217;ve been open since December &#8211; 0/10 for observation. We had jamaican jerk chicken, curried mutton with rice and beans and a roti and apart from the fact that it had cooled down quite a bit by the time we walked back home, it was all great and I look forward to trying some other dishes next time.

On Saturday, whilst we had the family visiting we had fish and chips from our favourite chippy, [Bankers](http://bankersrestaurant.com/). We discovered Bankers shortly after [moving to Brighton](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/ealing2brighton/) 5 years ago, and apart from the [Rick Stein place in Padstow](http://www.rickstein.com/restaurants_steinsfishandchips.htm), it is some of the best fish and chips I&#8217;ve had.

On Sunday, after our family had left our friends Neela and Ste, and their friend Jana came to see us and we headed off to try a new Brazilian BBQ place, Caucau, that has only been open a few weeks. I&#8217;ve never eaten Brazilian food before, and to be honest we needed a Brazilian guide as we had no idea what to do with the [farova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farofa) ([cassava](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava) flour). The service was good, and they did try and help us out, but sometimes you just need to be shown what to do :-).
