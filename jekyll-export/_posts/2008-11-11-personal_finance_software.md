For a long time I used [Quicken](http://www.quicken.co.uk/) for personal finance stuff, and eventually for freelancing too. It did the job quite nicely for a while, but I hit a few blocks with it: the upgrades promised more than they delivered; the data format was so stupid it was effectively impossible to move to different software; and then they dropped support for the UK. When I moved to the Mac I discovered the Mac version was just terrible, so for a while it was the only Windows app I was stuck with. This was all some years ago. 

The solution we ended up with is [Moneydance](http://moneydance.com/). I&#8217;ve been using it now for at least a couple of years, and it&#8217;s worked out really well as a personal finance replacement for Quicken. It runs on the Mac, Windows, and Linux so no problems moving between operating systems. It&#8217;s sane. It works.

It&#8217;s weakness was in invoicing, and for that reason, I&#8217;ve never used it for business. It does VAT, it does produce reports, so you can use it for business, but I wanted a more complete package for business, so I&#8217;ve settled (again, for some years) on using [MYOB](http://myob.com/). I find it a bit of odd in places but I think that&#8217;s more to do with accountancy than software. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m uncertain what&#8217;s happening with MYOB right now: looks like they&#8217;ve been moved to someone called [Mamut](http://www.mamut.com/uk/myob/product/), and I don&#8217;t know what the plans are there.

So whilst I can&#8217;t really suggest you look at MYOB (in the future I&#8217;ll be looking to move to something more on-line, I suspect), Moneydance has been an absolute star.
