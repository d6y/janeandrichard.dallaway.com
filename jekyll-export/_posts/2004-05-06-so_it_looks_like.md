So it looks like the West Pier ([the remains](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_01_28/), I mean) will be demolished. The [Heritage Lottery Fund](http://www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk/) withdrew their &#163;14m funds when the [West Pier Trust](http://www.westpier.co.uk) asked for another &#163;5m. After fires and weather damage, they couldn&#8217;t [justify spending the money](http://thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/news/local_issues/west_pier/news/pier77.html). 

Who is going to pay for the demolition? I guess that I am, along with all the other council tax payers in the area. I was just trying to figure out what [an estimated](http://www.thisisbrighton.co.uk/brighton__hove/news/local_issues/west_pier/) &#163;2m demolition fee would cost me. It&#8217;s not easy to work out&#8230;

Brighton receives around &#163;67m+ in council tax revenue ([PDF report)](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/site01.cfm?request=c1118081), from a [population](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/site01.cfm?request=b1117002) of 248,000. Guessing at four people per property, that makes 62,000 homes and an average council tax bill of &#163;1,092. Seems a little high, but let&#8217;s run with it.

That means a demolition would add &#163;32 to the average council tax bill. Or&#8230; how about considering the [restoration](http://www.westpier-trust.demon.co.uk/proposals/intro.htm) as an investment? &#163;19m contribution to a rebuild as a tax would add about &#163;102 for three years (I&#8217;m assuming it&#8217;s going to take a while to rebuild the thing). Doesn&#8217;t sound so bad, but I&#8217;d need to see the guesstimates for the return on that investment to make sure the tax bill goes down in subsequent years. 

I know all these calculations are naive, but it&#8217;d be interesting to see them run by someone who understood the politics, processes and accountancy.
