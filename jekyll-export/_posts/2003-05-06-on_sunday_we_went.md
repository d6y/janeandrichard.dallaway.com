On Sunday we went to see [&#1040;&#1083;&#1077;&#1082;&#1089;&#1072;&#1085;&#1076;&#1088; &#1053;&#1077;&#1074;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;&#1081;](http://www.openix.com/~danb/nevsky.htm) (also known as [Aleksandr Nevsky](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/index.asp?id=471)). It&#8217;s a 1938 Russian propaganda film about [a prince](http://www.cnit.uniyar.ac.ru/yaros/wwe00048.htm) who leads the Russians against all sorts of Bad People, and in this case it was shown with [the Philharmonia Orchestra](http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/) supplying the music and the [Brighton festival Chorus](http://www.bfc.org.uk/) singing in Russian (I think).

Sounds mad; was wonderful. Lots of funny moments. The battle on the ice could have been cut by 20 mins IMHO, as that part didn&#8217;t have me &#8220;on the edge of my seat&#8221; as was advertised.
