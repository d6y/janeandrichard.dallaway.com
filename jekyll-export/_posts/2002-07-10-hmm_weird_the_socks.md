Hmm, weird. The socks I&#8217;m wearing today seem to have a slightly velcro like property to them. Or at least they stick ever so slightly to the carpet in the office (yes, I spend most of my day wandering around in my socks). Very strange. Haven&#8217;t noticed it before, but then these don&#8217;t get worn very often &#8211; they&#8217;re kind of an emergency pair.
