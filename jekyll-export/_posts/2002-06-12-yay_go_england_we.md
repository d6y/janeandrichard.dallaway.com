Yay! Go England. We go through to the next round and the Nigerians and the Argentines go home. For a 0-0 draw it was pretty tense stuff at times but, we&#8217;re through and we play Denmark at lunchtime on Saturday.

I watched it at home and then cycled in to work to start the rest of my day &#8211; flexi time is a wonderful thing ðŸ™‚
