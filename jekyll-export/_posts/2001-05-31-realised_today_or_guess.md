I realised today (or I guess more accurately yesterday now) that blogvoices was not running at the moment. We&#8217;ve been thinking for a while about creating bulletin boards for other areas of the site, so people can post back about their travels in the countries we&#8217;ve been to, or can agree or disagree about our gadget reviews. So, tonight we&#8217;ve been adding that functionality. At the moment it only runs from the blog and gadget pages. Soon we hope to get it running off more parts of the site. We&#8217;ve used some XML based Perl freeware software &#8211; [XML Board](http://xmlboard.hypermart.net/). So, now all the comments are stored on our server, and we&#8217;re no longer forced to deal with any delays/unreliabilities of getting to an externally hosted board. We&#8217;ve rescued the comments from blogvoices and imported them as a starting point.

Take a look at our [blog discussions](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/cgi-bin/xmlboardsolo.cgi?board=blog&action=index) or the [gadget discussions](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/cgi-bin/xmlboardsolo.cgi?board=gadgets&action=index) boards.
