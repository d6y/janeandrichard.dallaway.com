On Saturday night we cycled down to Preston Park to catch
  
Groupe F&#8217;s [A Little More Light](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/PREVIEW2.html) firework show. These are the people who did the fireworks around the Eiffel Tower for New Year&#8217;s eve 2000. It was impressive (but short) and I&#8217;ve not seen so many people for a long, long time. 15,000? No idea. 

Actually, going cycling on a Saturday night felt like one of the nerdiest thing I&#8217;ve done for ages. But it was top fun.. especially having to twist and turn through so many cars and people on foot on their way to/from the fireworks. 

This was at the end of the day, after having been caught up in the events of the [North Laine](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/news/NEWS9.html). Jane&#8217;s put together [the pictures](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/20020511/).
