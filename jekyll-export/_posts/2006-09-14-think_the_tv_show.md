I think the TV show [Who Do You Think You Are?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory) is a perfect example of the BBC meeting their charter [to inform, educate and entertain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/charter/pdf/charter_text.shtml) all in one programme. You&#8217;ve got celebrity for the entrainment, information in terms of history, and education in terms of genealogy. And just to reinforce the BBC stamp on it, you&#8217;ve got [Doctor Who](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/get_started/wdytya_celeb_gallery_04.shtml) turning up in it on 27th September.
