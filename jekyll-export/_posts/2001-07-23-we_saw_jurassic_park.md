We saw [Jurassic Park III](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0163025) on Friday. Yeah, the dinosaurs look a bit better, but don&#8217;t bother. No story, or what story there is you&#8217;ve seen before. Bah. 

By chance we were very bored on Saturday (more about that later) and caught the original [Jurassic Park](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0107290) on TV and the contrast was striking: that film is just so much better than JP3.
