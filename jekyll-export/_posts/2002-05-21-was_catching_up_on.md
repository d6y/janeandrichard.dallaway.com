I was catching up on the reportings of [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk) this morning, and I noticed [this article](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/25361.html). Basically, it&#8217;s about 4 people who are &#8220;living&#8221; in Harrods shop window for the week to publicise some of LG Electronics new gadgets &#8211; a [fridge freezer](http://www.lginternetfamily.co.uk/fridge.asp) which has a built in MP3 player, LCD display, camera and full internet access, a [microwave](http://www.lginternetfamily.co.uk/micro.asp) which can download recipes from the internet, a [washing machine](http://www.lginternetfamily.co.uk/washingmachine.asp) which you can turn on remotely via the internet and an [air conditioner](http://www.lginternetfamily.co.uk/aircon.asp) which you can adjust remotely via the internet. Interesting products, and a strange way of advertising them. I guess it is all part of the UKs current need for more &#8220;reality tv&#8221; type situations (the third series of [Big Brother](http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bigbrother/) starts on Friday evening). If you&#8217;re interested, you can [watch](http://www.lginternetfamily.co.uk/livecams.asp) them or catch up on their [news](http://www.lginternetfamily.co.uk/news.asp).

This did make me think about something we saw on Saturday at Fenwicks in York. As we left the shop clutching our wedding related purchases, we heard a voice coming over some speakers. I turned around and realised that it was a beauty consultant doing a facial on some poor lady in one of the main windows of the store. The lady was lying down whilst the consultant talked us all through what she was doing, and what particular problem areas this lady needed help with. Weird, very weird!
