I was just listening to [Five Live](http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live) and heard a news story about a [woman destroying lots of art work which her son had stolen](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/arts/newsid_1990000/1990836.stm). Bizarre. If it isn&#8217;t bad enough that someone steals all this art work (worth &#xA3;960m), but then to have his Mother destroy it all because she is angry with her son. Shocking!
