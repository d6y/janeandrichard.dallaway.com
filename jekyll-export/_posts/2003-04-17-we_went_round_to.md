We went round to see Paul and Tess&#8217;s new house last night, and very lovely it is too. We were in no rush, and they had no other plans, so we ordered a takeaway curry and sat and had a very lovely meal. Now we don&#8217;t order takeaway food very often as we often find the quality suffers, but the [Nishat Tandoori](http://www.brightonandhove.cc/Nishat%20Tandoori%20(menu).htm) had some lovely dishes (it does Goan and Indian so there were a few interesting variations). And what is even better, is that it&#8217;s only a couple of streets away from our house. Smashing.
