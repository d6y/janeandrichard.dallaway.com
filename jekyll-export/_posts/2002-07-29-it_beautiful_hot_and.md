It&#8217;s a beautiful hot and sunny day here in Brighton, and I&#8217;m suffering. Our office has no air conditioning, so we have the windows open and the fan blowing but it&#8217;s not really cooling me down. Normally, we&#8217;re really casual here, and so in normal circumstances I&#8217;d have been sitting here in t-shirt and shorts. Unfortunately today we&#8217;re all &#8220;suited and booted&#8221; for a meeting in London this afternoon, of all the days we have to be smart. Still at least the car has air conditioning so the journey won&#8217;t be so bad&#8230;
