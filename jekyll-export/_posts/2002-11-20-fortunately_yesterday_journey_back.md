Fortunately, yesterday&#8217;s journey back from Chesterfield to Brighton was much smoother than [last weeks](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/11/yesterday_was_the_worst) and I got home only 10 minutes late. A miracle!

Yesterday I used my time wisely &#8211; I listened to a talk by Tim O&#8217;Reilly (him of the [O&#8217;Reilly books](http://www.oreilly.com/)) on &#8220;[The shape of things to come](http://technetcast.ddj.com/tnc_play_stream.html?stream_id=696)&#8220;, I read some more of my current work-related book [&#8220;Love is the killer App&#8221; by Tim Sanders](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0340824867/richarddallaway) (another good read, this time about the power of networking with other people and helping people out &#8211; being a &#8220;lovecat&#8221;). I also then decided it was time to work through my address book in my Handera, and so started emailing people I hadn&#8217;t heard from in a while. Some of them have dissapeared off the face of the earth, but I&#8217;ve had some lovely responses from others. A good use of those 4 hours travelling time.

Oh yes, I was also sneezing and sniffing a fair bit as I seem to have become a bit of a snot monster again. I&#8217;m taking today off and am sitting at home trying to rest up and recover.
