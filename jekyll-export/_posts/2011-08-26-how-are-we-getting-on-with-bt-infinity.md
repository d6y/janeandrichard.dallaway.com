> How do you get on with BT Infinity in general? I was going to sign up but plan to move house in < 18 months so didn&#8217;t want the contract

Good question.  Moving ISP is a scary thing, better the devil you know, and all that.  For us especially so as Be, our previous ISP, were pretty good.  But we can&#8217;t get cable where we are (our neighbours can, we can&#8217;t: long story), so for speed no-one else can compare with BT for us.

In summary, we&#8217;re getting on very well in the most part.  During the day, we reliably see download speeds of 35+ Mbps and upload speeds of 8 Mbps.  That upload speed is fantastic for shipping photos around.  Not measured the evening performance, but not noticed any problems either.

The hardware (modem and wifi) are OK.  The modem died in the first month, but it was replaced by a BT engineer in 48 hours.  You can&#8217;t change the DNS on the wifi unit, which is a pain as BT&#8217;s DNS servers have crapped out on us once already.  But in general, you turn it on, it works.

I need to start keeping a log, but in the last couple of months I think there have been two outages. In both cases it took 3+ hours to resolve.  One was a DNS problem, and today&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what the problem was but it affected more than just BT.

All ISPs have outages, but the real difficulty with BT is getting a status report or even an acknowledgement that they know there&#8217;s a problem.  They do have a [web status page](http://btbusiness.custhelp.com/app/service_status) but it&#8217;s never seems up to date.   Phoning them up is a waste of time. The [@BTCare](http://twitter.com/btcare) account tries, but can&#8217;t keep up, so you don&#8217;t often get any feedback until the issue is resolved.

Which is all a shame, because mostly it works and works well.  If BT were on the ball when there was a problem, I&#8217;d actually recommend them.
