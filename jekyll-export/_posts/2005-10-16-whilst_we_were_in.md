Whilst we were in Cornwall, we had the good fortune to discover [Bangors Organic Tea Room and Restaurant](http://www.bangorsorganic.co.uk/). Not only does it do lovely lunches, and cream teas, but it also has a couple of rooms available for [bed and organic breakfast](http://www.bangorsorganic.co.uk/accommodation.htm). We might just consider this next time we&#8217;re down there.
