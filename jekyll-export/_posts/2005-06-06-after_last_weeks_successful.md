After [last weeks successful wine tastings](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2005/05/to_celebrate_english_wine), we thought we&#8217;d give another one a try before the end of [English Wine Week](http://www.english-wine-week.com/) and so headed off to [Sedlescombe Organic Vineyard](http://www.englishorganicwine.co.uk/). They have a nature trail as well as a shop selling their [wines](https://www.proteusweb.com/engorg/acatalog/Wines.html), and [fruit juices](https://www.proteusweb.com/engorg/acatalog/English_Organic_Fruit_Juices.html) as well as other organic products. We tasted 4 of their wines, and came away with a selection of bottles to enjoy over summer.
