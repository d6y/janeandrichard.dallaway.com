So the [fixtures are out for Hull&#8217;s first season in the Premiership](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/fixtures/default.stm) and it starts with a home game against Fulham. As Richard pointed out, I should take a screen shot of the table now, as we&#8217;re currently 8th, so here we are, recorded for posterity ðŸ™‚

Being the geek that I am, I&#8217;ve used the [BBC fixtures link](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/fixtures/default.stm), some [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) macro generation, a bit of Excel date manipulation and some hand crafted code to generate a [Hull City Fixtures](http://jane.dallaway.com/downloads/iCal/HullCityFixtures.ics) [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) file.  
There are no guarantees I&#8217;ll keep it up to date, but to the best of my knowledge it is correct today
