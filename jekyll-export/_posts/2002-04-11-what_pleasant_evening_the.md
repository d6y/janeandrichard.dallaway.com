What a pleasant evening. The weather was fine, with a bit of a breeze and so we decided to go and attend our first [Brighton Kite Flyers](http://www.brightonkiteflyers.co.uk/) Fly-in at Stanmer Park. Our first mission was to untangle the lines for the [Janus](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/newjanus/) which we did with a little help from Simon, one of the BKF members. Then we got the kite up for it&#8217;s first flight this year, and fun it was too. Most of the other kites flying were big single line affairs, and Simon mentioned that we might grow into these kites as they are far more sociable than these complicated multi-line jobs.

When the light failed, we decided to head off in search of a pub serving food, and ended up doing quite a few miles to get to the Shepherd and Dog in Fulking. I&#8217;d been here with the guys from work a month or so ago and so knew that it was pretty good. It seems to have had some [poor reviews](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/pubs/shepherdanddog.html) in the past, but we have no complaints. It&#8217;s not cheap as pub food goes, but the portions were generous, and the food was tasty.

As we were driving home in the dark along the country lanes Rich realised that it was a clear night and there were lots of stars to be seen, so we did a quick detour via Devil&#8217;s Dyke and had a look at them &#8211; it was too cold to study them in too much detail.
