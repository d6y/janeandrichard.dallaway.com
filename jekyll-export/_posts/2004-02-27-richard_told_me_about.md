[Richard](http://www.world66.com/member/d6y) told me about [World66](http://www.world66.com/) today&#8230; So, I&#8217;ve been and filled in my map &#8211; pretty poor attempt. Must travel more&#8230;

Even the European map doesn&#8217;t look that well travelled (although I haven&#8217;t included any country that I haven&#8217;t stopped for at least a day)
