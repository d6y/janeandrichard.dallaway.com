We&#8217;ve been out searching for office space this afternoon and unfortunately there doesn&#8217;t seem to be that much quality space available in the Brighton area. We only looked at one place today and it reminded me of a student house, dark and a bit dingey. It was a flat really, not purpose built office space and it had a pale pink and black bathroom, complete with a bath! Not very professional looking really.
