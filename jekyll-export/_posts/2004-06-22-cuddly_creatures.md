Some friends have just had a baby boy, to go with their already lovely daughter. A couple of years ago we sent a [lovely bear](http://www.hugsandcuddles.co.uk/products/Moonbeam_14_inch.html) to some other friends through [Hugs and Cuddles](http://www.hugsandcuddles.co.uk/). Unfortunately, the bear is out of stock at the moment, and so I started looking around for other cuddly toy sites &#8211; and [interfauna](http://www.interfauna.co.uk/) is the winner. Not only has it a fantastic name, but it also has a massive range of animals &#8211; even a [jellyfish](http://www.interfauna.co.uk/mall/Interfauna/products/product-1063837.stm), . This time, however, the [red panda](http://www.interfauna.co.uk/mall/Interfauna/products/product-800974.stm) wins.
