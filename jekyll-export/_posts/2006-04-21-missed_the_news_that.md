I missed the news that [Muriel Spark had died](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4911878.stm). Those with good memories may remember that [one of my photographs](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/summerfireworks/img_0449_640/) was used as the cover for [All the Poems of Muriel Spark](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811215768/richarddallaway) a couple of years ago.
