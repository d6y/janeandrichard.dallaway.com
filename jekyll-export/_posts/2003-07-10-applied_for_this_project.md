I applied for [this project](http://www.noagenciesplease.com/index.html?action=project&id=3874) at [Freelancers.Net](http://www.freelancers.net/) the other day. Last night I got an email from the company asking if I could look at some emergency for them on the [Clix](http://www.clix.co.uk/) site. I did, and sorted it for them, but whilst we were chatting the guy said that they&#8217;d had 120 responses to that advert, and that some people were offering to do the work for free just so they could put it onto their portfolio. I guess that&#8217;s why I hadn&#8217;t heard anything from them about that work. Time will tell if I get any further work from them on the strength of my emergency-helping-out ability.
