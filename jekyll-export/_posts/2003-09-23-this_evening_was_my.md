This evening was my first visit of the year to the [Brighton and Hove Camera Club](www.bhcc-online.co.uk). Our speaker this evening was [John Devenport](http://www.ashford-quest-photo-soc.co.uk/john-devenport.htm) showing prints on the theme of &#8220;Monochrome Images&#8221;. Some of them were very impressive, although I must be honest and say that he showed far too many photos for my taste &#8211; by the end of the evening I was suffering with a numb bum &#8211; one of the perils of sitting on the cheap seats at the back of the room. Despite that a very inspiring presentation, and it has made me want to go and get the camera out and start taking some more photos.
