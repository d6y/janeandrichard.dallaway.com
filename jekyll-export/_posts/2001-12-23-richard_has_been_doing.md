Richard has been doing some work on the photos section of the site over the last couple of weeks. This has meant a bit of a delay getting some of the photos onto the site. Today I&#8217;ve put another 3 albums up. The [first](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622760966180/) is from the 13th December when Joe came down and we had a &#8220;photo play day&#8221; (too cold really if truth be told). The [second](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622636613235/) are just some shots I took in the Churchill Square shopping centre of the decorations. And the [last](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622759328212/) are from our day out along the coast yesterday with my parents (who have come down for Christmas).
