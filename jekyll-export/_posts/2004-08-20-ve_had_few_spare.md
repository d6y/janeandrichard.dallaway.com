I&#8217;ve had a few spare browsing moments at work today so I&#8217;ve been catching up on some favourite spots. Through [Black and White Photography](http://www.nyclondon.com/blog/archives/2004/08/07/london_tube_map.blog) I found [Animals on the Underground](http://www.animalsontheunderground.com/). I can&#8217;t decide whether I like the [fish](http://www.animalsontheunderground.com/images/fish_back2.gif) or the [dog](http://www.animalsontheunderground.com/images/dog_back2.gif) the best.
