Over Christmas we recorded [Iris](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280778/) when it was on the tv. Last night we got around to watching it. It&#8217;s a very, very good film, although it is pretty upsetting watching such a sharp mind deteriorate due to Alzheimers disease. The acting was very good, and Jim Broadbent totally deserved [his oscar](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2002/oscars_2002/1887921.stm) for it as his sense of frustration felt so real. One thing they didn&#8217;t do was give any indication of the timeline of her deterioration, but on [further investigation](http://www.aesthetics-online.org/memorials/bonzon.html) it appears to have been 4 or 5 years. [Dementia](http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/) is such an awful disease, stripping away facets of personality leaving a barely recognisable shell, and as yet their is no cure &#8211; just treatments that delay the inevitable.
