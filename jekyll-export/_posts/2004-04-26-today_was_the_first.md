Today was the first day on my c# course with [Xpertise](http://www.xpertise.co.uk/). I haven&#8217;t had an opportunity to work with .Net before so this is a great opportunity. So tonight I&#8217;ve installed the [SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=9B3A2CA6-3647-4070-9F41-A333C6B9181D&displaylang=en). I don&#8217;t have a Visual Studio .Net license, so instead I downloaded [#develop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx), a free development environment which so far appears to work okay. It comes with [ndoc](http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/wiki) for documentation and #unit for unit testing, althought I&#8217;m probably going to use [nunit](http://www.nunit.org/) instead.
