We&#8217;ve recently got into the bad habit of eating biscuits at work. This week I brought in a [packet of chocolate biscuits](http://www.ciao.co.uk/Cadbury_Milk_Chocolate_Biscuit_Selection__Review_5320926) Richard and I were given for Christmas, and they really are fabulous. Worth every calorie and worth remembering for next time we want a chocolatey treat!
