The launch of the first Nasa Mars mission has been delayed again. It was supposed to go on Sunday, but [thunderclouds prevented it](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,59161,00.html). Another attempt was going to be made yesterday but the [threat of thunderstorms](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,59163,00.html) stopped it going. They&#8217;re hoping to get it off today.
