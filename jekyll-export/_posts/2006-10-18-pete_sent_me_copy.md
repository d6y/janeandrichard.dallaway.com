[Pete](http://www.twinset.org/graphics/gallery/pic005.jpg) sent me a copy of [Twinset](http://www.twinset.org/)&#8216;s debut album [Low Burlesque](http://www.twinset.org/album1.html) a few weeks ago. I&#8217;ve listened to it on a number of occasions now and I&#8217;m quite enjoying it, my current favourite is still [Be Alone Tonight](http://www.twinset.org/mp3/Twinset%20-%20Be%20Alone%20Tonight.mp3). Of course they have a [myspace presence](http://www.myspace.com/twinset), and you can also listen to the album online for free at [soundclick](http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pagemusic.cfm?bandID=597386)
