Short story: Putting together [BoConcept](http://www.boconcept.com/) flat-pack furniture is more involved that slapping together something from Ikea, but you end up with something far more sturdy. Their also have superior customer service. 

Longer story: We were missing one part from our flat-pack order (don&#8217;t ya hate it when that happens). Or rather we weren&#8217;t because we never ordered it. But then again we didn&#8217;t go into the store saying we want one of these bits, and two of those bits (etc). Rather, we said &#8220;we want something that looks like this&#8221; and the guy in the store said &#8220;a-ha, then you&#8217;ll need one of these, two of those&#8230;yada yada&#8221;. So it was their design error that left us short one piece. That&#8217;s how we look at it, but you can imagine the sort of prolonged in-store argument this problem could lead to, no doubt with reference to small-print about checking the order. But 30 minutes after realizing there was something missing, I was walking home with the extra bit it in my hand&#8230; no arguments, no discussion, no 6 week shipping delays, no exchange of money. That&#8217;s good customer service. 

So: BoConcept: stupid name, not cheap, not fast, but overall very much worth it.

Oh my, that was a dull blog.
