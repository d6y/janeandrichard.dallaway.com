Hey, I won a photographic contest. The [Underexposed](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnderExposed/) group I belong to have a monthly contest and this month&#8217;s theme was &#8220;After Dark/Sunset&#8221;. I haven&#8217;t won a photography contest since I was about 15, so I&#8217;m really pleased, especially as the other entries were all excellent too.
