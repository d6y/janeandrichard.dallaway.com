Have you been got by any good April Fools Day gags today then? So far, I&#8217;ve isolated myself away from the outside world and haven&#8217;t heard any. When I was little my Dad always used to wake me up on April Fools morning to tell me it had been snowing, without fail, every year until I was around 13 (when it really had been snowing and he couldn&#8217;t work out what to say).

The best and most effective one I&#8217;ve heard in recent years, was about 5 years ago when April Fools Day fell on a Saturday. [Capital Radio](http://www.capitalfm.com) always broadcast a weekday morning show with Chris Tarrant as the DJ. On this Saturday morning, they did a broadcast as if it was Friday, with typical travel reports, talk about weekend plans etc etc. As the morning progressed and Chris admitted it was a joke he got a load of phone calls from people sitting in quiet offices wondering why not many other people were in, it didn&#8217;t catch me out but I did have to think twice to realise what was going on. Good one Capital.
