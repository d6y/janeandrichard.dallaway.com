Is there anything that can&#8217;t be Abba-ified? I suspect not after noticing that June 10th is [Brighton Racecource](http://www.brighton-racecourse.co.uk/)&#8216;s &#8220;Thank you for the races&#8221; Abba night. 

I quote: &#8220;This Super Trouper Evening will include a Live Tribute Band, competitions for the best dressed Abba character and drinks promotions all night &#8211; Mamma Mia this is a night not to be missed!&#8221;
