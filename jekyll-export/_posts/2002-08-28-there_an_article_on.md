There&#8217;s an [article](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/dynamic/news/top_story.html?in_review_id=680046&in_review_text_id=652463) on the [ThisisLondon.co.uk](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk) site about the temperatures on the London Underground during summer &#8211; it&#8217;s hotter than the EU regulations for transporting animals, but there are no regulations for transporting people apparently!. Glad I don&#8217;t have to use the tube any more.
