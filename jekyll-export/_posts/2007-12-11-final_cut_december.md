Tonight is the December [Final Cut screening at Komedia](http://www.finalcut.gb.com/month.html), and I&#8217;ve not had chance to blog about the last one I went to in October. As it starts in an hour and a half, I&#8217;ll just quickly say it&#8217;s an evening of short films. All sorts of short films: funny, serious, animated, local&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure if there are any rules. 

We primarily went in October to see Dave&#8217;s [Work Socks](http://youtube.com/watch?v=SgZZ3-cVCdk), but I enjoyed every minute of the whole evening. Go to it, it&#8217;s good. 

Tonight is a Christmas special. With mince pies&#8230; but I&#8217;m going to miss it. 7:30 at Komedia, &#163;4 on the door.
