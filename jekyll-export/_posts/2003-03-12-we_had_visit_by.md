We had a visit by the police at work yesterday in relation to an [attack](http://www.thisisbrighton.co.uk/brighton__hove/archive/2003/03/10/NEWS210ZM.html) that happened on Friday night/Saturday morning just outside. It was routine questioning &#8211; &#8220;were you in the office between midnight on Friday and 5.30am on Saturday&#8221; &#8211; wonder if they&#8217;ll find anyone who was. The guy who was attacked sometimes works as the cook in the cafe in the [office](http://www.maritimehouse.com/) and so is someone that we all recognise.

Sounds like a good reason, if I needed one, to make sure that I&#8217;ve left the office before it gets dark.
