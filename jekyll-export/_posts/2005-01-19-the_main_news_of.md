The [main news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/world/2004/asia_quake_disaster/) of the day eclipsed this somewhat, but I&#8217;ll report it now&#8230; 

Last year [Andy dressed up in a santa costume](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2004/01/well_done_to_jeremy) and hit the sea on Christmas day. He made the local paper, which was kind of fun. 

This year Jeremy, Andy, Ben and Kirsty all went in on Christmas Day in santa costumes. Alas, we weren&#8217;t there to witness this, but on [Boxing Day](http://www.cheekysquirrel.net/blog/archives/000342.html) (American cousins: it&#8217;s December 26th) Jeremy called with the news that a photo of Kirsty had made it into the [News of the World](http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/). We later found out that a similar picture had made it into [Mail on Sunday](http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk), both national papers. 

At the news agent I discovered just how much they&#8217;d upped the ante: they were there on the front page of the [Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/). Above the fold. On a proper grown up paper. And a fantastic photo (but not a great scan, by me):

Nice work! The photo was also used in a BBC report: [Brave swimmers take festive dip](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4125853.stm).
