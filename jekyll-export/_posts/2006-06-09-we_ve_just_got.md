We&#8217;ve just got back from a really pleasant few days break in Prague (of which more later I&#8217;m sure). As is now traditional, we had to find a wall chart for the [world cup](http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/index.html), and having failed to find one before we left the UK, this years is from the Czech magazine [HATTRICK](http://www.hattrick.cz/). The special World Cup issue also contains team information, and their predictions. So, according to HATTRICK the winners will be [Argentina](http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/team/overview.html?team=arg), with the [Czech Republic](http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/team/overview.html?team=cze) in 2nd place. Third will go to the [Netherlands](http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/team/overview.html?team=ned) and 4th to [Brazil](http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/team/overview.html?team=bra). And what do they say about [England](http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/team/overview.html?team=eng)? We&#8217;ll go out in the 2nd round.
