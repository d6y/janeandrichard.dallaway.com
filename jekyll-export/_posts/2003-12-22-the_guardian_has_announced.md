[The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/) has announced it&#8217;s [Best Blogs for 2003](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/weblogs/story/0,14024,1108883,00.html), and the photography based ones are very strong, I can see me adding the winner, [nyclondon.com](http://www.nyclondon.com/blog/), to my favourites.

_&#8220;Black and white also featured in the winner of the best use of photography category. This went to Rob Gardiner and [nyclondon.com](http://www.nyclondon.com/blog/) for the stunning quality of his photography. We also commended two others in this category: [Camerantics](http://elephants.brinkster.net/), which also featured among the judges&#8217; selections in the best design category, and [Apparently Nothing](http://www.apparentlynothing.com/) &#8211; both full of arresting images and enough to make the average aspirant snapper (like me) sick with envy.&#8221;_
