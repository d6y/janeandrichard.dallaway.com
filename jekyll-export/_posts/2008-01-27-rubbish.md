The [Communal Bin Consultation](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1120661) has started in the little bit of Brighton we live in. Potentially a good idea, but I think one to reject. If you&#8217;re not sure if you&#8217;re affected take a look at the [map of the proposed and existing bin locations (PDF)](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/downloads/bhcc/refuse/Existing_and_Proposed_communal_bins_website.pdf).

We&#8217;re told: &#8220;The containers will be emptied regularly to prevent them from overflowing. Where we currently have bins we do not have any problems.&#8221; Ah come off it&#8230; no problems at all? I&#8217;ve seen over-flowing bins, and a good percentage of the one&#8217;s I&#8217;ve seen are broken (as in the photo above). 

But anyway&#8230; a dull topic&#8230; and one that&#8217;s been discussed [for a while](http://www.regencybrighton.com/issues/bins/2007/10/16/bin-debate/), and [rejected by many](http://www.davenportdigital.com/category/communal-bins/). It&#8217;s just one of [the usual issues](http://www.fixmystreet.com/reports/Brighton+and+Hove).

BTW: there&#8217;s a surprising number of [photos of Brighton bins](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=brighton%20bins&w=all) knocking around.
