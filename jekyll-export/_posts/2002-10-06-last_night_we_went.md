Last night we went to see
  
the [Brighton Bears](http://www.brightonbears.com/)
  
play the [Thames Valley Tigers](http://www.tvtigers.co.uk/).
  
This is the first basketball game we&#8217;ve been to. Before the game I
  
had a quick look at the rules so we had a chance of understanding the game. Glad
  
I did because otherwise we&#8217;d have no idea why there was a clock that counted down
  
from 24 seconds. Still don&#8217;t understand what is and isn&#8217;t a foul, but there&#8217;s
  
plenty of time to read-up on the rules over
  
at the [British Basketball League](http://www.bbl.org.uk/) web site. 

The Bears won [88-63](http://www.brightonbears.com/news/news_detail.asp?news_id=92), and all the players were impressive, especially [the captain](http://www.brightonbears.com/team/randy_duck.asp). 

It&#8217;s fast, entertaining, and I think we&#8217;ll go again. And the crowd turn out was impressive, too.
