Congratulations to Karl. He ran the marathon in 5hrs 26 minutes yesterday. He says he&#8217;s got some really lovely blisters to show for his day, and can hardly walk. But he did it. Well done! You can still sponsor him [here](http://www.justgiving.com/karlhoods/) and help the [British Lung Foundation](http://www.lunguk.org/). There&#8217;s a photo of him with his medal [here](http://www.actionphoto.net/gallery/gallery_lrg.asp?pg=1&race=16&rcnam=Flora+London+Marathon&rcn=41405).
