Jeremy and Kirsty have a guest staying with them at the moment, a small, cute, furry, four legged friend called Freddie. He&#8217;s a very enthusiastic cocker spaniel. We met up with them last night to take him for a walk along the beach. Dog walking is fun, but that&#8217;s easy for me to say because Jeremy was the one picking up the dog output.
