I was cycling down Preston Street this morning, when this huge blue American truck started driving towards me. Now, I only know of one person who drives a truck like this in Brighton, [Chris Eubank](http://www.danish-boxing.dk/boxers/chris-eubank.htm). And it was him. No time for a photo, I was too busy getting out of the way!
