I spotted this guy waiting outside the Apple Store in Regent Street during our [day trip to London](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2005_02_12/) yesterday. We left the Apple store with an [early birthday present for me](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodshuffle/), which I guess means that Richard gets custody of the [20GB iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/) we bought [in New York](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/ny2004/index.html) last year.
