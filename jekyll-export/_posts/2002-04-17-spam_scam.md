I got sent some e-mail spam today, not altogether unusual, but this was a scam spam. The basic details are that it is sent from a DR. SAM BASHIRU (Director, ECO Bank Plc) basically telling me that a JAMES AKMEH died over a year ago in a ghastly air crash and had in his bank account at the time US$21.6M. The email wanted me to pose as a next-of-kin to James Akmeh and in doing so I would give my account details and 30% of the money would be mine, 5% would pay joint expenses and 65% would go to the originators of the transaction. All they needed from me would be my bank account details, and personal telephone/fax details. Tempting. Not!

I did a bit of research, and of course found it noted on several websites &#8211; some of the details were changed but the format were the same ([Scam o Rama](http://www.scamorama.com/scam64.shtml), [Tanko Zuba](http://www.dcmsoft.com/zuba/zuba/deadbank1.htm)). I also decided to do a search on a few of the other details, like Eco Bank. There is no Eco Bank (and [google](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=eco+bank+nigeria) helpfully points to several scam sites when I search for it) but there does appear to be an EcoBank (although I can&#8217;t seem to get a response from their [website](http://www.ecobank.com/) at the moment). The email is sent by a sam_bash2000@yahoo.com &#8211; sounds like a good, solid email address then! I just wonder how many poor unsuspecting people actually do give their details out.
