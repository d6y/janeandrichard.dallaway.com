[Black box recorder](http://www.indian.co.uk/artists/bbr/) (warning: site auto-plays music. duh) have a [new album](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008BXH3/richarddallaway) out, which is ever-so good. My copy came from [cdwow](http://www.cd-wow.com/).

Alas, we couldn&#8217;t get to see them when they [came to Brighton](http://bluefiremusic.tripod.com/id49.htm) (warning: annoying popups. bah) earlier this month.

We&#8217;ve also been listening to [The Electric Soft Parade](http://www.electricsoftparade.com/), and recently found out they&#8217;re local after watching &#8220;Brighton Beats&#8221; (6 parts series on ITV, Thursdays 23:30).
