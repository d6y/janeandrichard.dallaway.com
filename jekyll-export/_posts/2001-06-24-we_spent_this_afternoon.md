We spent this afternoon at the [Middlesex Show](http://www.middlesexshow.com). As well as having the usual stalls, it had a small farm exhibit with donkeys, turkeys, ducks and other such hot looking animals, it had a stage with an atrocious singer on, and it also had some equine events. We watched some of the [Scurrey racing](http://www.middlesexshow.com/areas/equine.htm#Scurry) but the highlight for us was probably watching the [Cleverdogs](http://members.aol.com/moderndogs/home.htm) events. We&#8217;ve seen this sort of event at Crufts (shown on the tv) before and this time we got to watch it for real. It was a really hot afternoon, and by the time one of the dogs
  
made it into the 3rd/4th place playoffs in the Division 1 event, the poor thing was just too hot to really be bothered. The dogs and handlers work really hard and they produced an excellent show for the spectators.
