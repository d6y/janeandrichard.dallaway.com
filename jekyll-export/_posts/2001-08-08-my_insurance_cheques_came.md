My insurance cheques came through yesterday for the items that I lost when my [bag was stolen](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/07/had_my_bag_stolen). We&#8217;re insured by [Nationwide Building Society](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/default.htm), and I think the fact that they turned around my claim in under 2 weeks was really impressive. Well done Nationwide.
