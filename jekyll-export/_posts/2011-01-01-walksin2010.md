During 2010 I walked 1282 miles in almost 675 hours (that&#8217;s 28 days) &#8211; there are [traces for some of them here](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/year2010/)

Almost all of these (with the exception of the first 2 weeks in January when we were in [Sydney](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/08/2-weeks-in-sydney/) and [Tokyo](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/08/50-hours-in-tokyo/)) were as a result of taking Skitters for a walk. Richard will have done a similar amount &#8211; I still do the morning walks, he does the lunchtime/evening walks and we both do the longer, more explorey, weekend walks.

I can&#8217;t believe that I spent almost a month of 2010 outside walking
