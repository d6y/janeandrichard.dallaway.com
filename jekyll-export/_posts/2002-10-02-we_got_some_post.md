We got some post at work today from the &#8220;Data Protection Registration Agency&#8221;. It was a form to fill in to be registered and to comply with the Data Protection Act 1988. It had &#8220;Final Notice&#8221; across the top of the form. Duncan had filled it all in, before we realised it was a scam. They were asking for &#xA3;95 + VAT as an administration fee. The form had a government look about it, but wasn&#8217;t quite right &#8211; that&#8217;s how we spotted it. I then did a quick search on google and found [this article](http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk/dpars.htm). Cheeky, cheeky people.
