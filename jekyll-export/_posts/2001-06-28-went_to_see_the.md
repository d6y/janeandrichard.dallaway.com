I went to see [&#8220;The Dish&#8221;](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0205873) at the cinema the other night. It&#8217;s an Australian film, based on the story of how the radiotelescope in Parkes, Australia relayed the moonwalk to 600 million people. I wasn&#8217;t sure how true to life the film was, but the [&#8220;On Eagle&#8217;s Wing&#8221;](http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/apollo11/) site seems to agree with most of it. That site, which is the Parkes view on things, makes quite interesting reading actually.

It&#8217;s a good film, not in the same league as [&#8220;Strictly Ballroom&#8221;](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0105488) or [&#8220;Muriel&#8217;s Wedding&#8221;](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0110598) but good nonetheless. (and those 2 films are personal favourites anyway).

I went with some friends from work and we watched it at the Warner Village cinema in Leicester Square. The Odeon was booked out and yet, less than 200 metres away we were the only 3 people in there for the majority of the film. It felt a bit like being a VIP.

After the film 2 of us went to [&#8220;Pizza Piazza&#8221;](http://www.pizzapiazza.co.uk/) for some dinner. This was pleasant and not too busy at all considering it is just around the corner from Leicester Square on Charing Cross Road.
