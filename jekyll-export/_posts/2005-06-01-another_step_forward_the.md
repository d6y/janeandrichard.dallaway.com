Another step forward: the council has [banned smoking](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4597853.stm) in the venues that it owns.
  
&#8220;A complete smoking ban cannot be implemented in the city without government approval but Brighton and Hove Council hope that could be brought in as early as next year.&#8221; If you want to move this along, the BBC have [some suggestions](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ican/A2702143).
