We met up with some friends from Aspect days yesterday, something which seems to becoming a bit of an annual event. One of them, Jules, has spent the last year or so starting up a new business, and has just launched [Anagram Works](http://www.anagramworks.co.uk/) in time to appear in a couple of the [Open Houses](http://www.openhouseonline.co.uk/) in Brighton during this year&#8217;s [Brighton Festival](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/). She&#8217;s made a series of [greetings cards](http://www.anagramworks.co.uk/products.html), as well as a [Brighton](http://www.anagramworks.co.uk/samples/Brighton.jpg) mug (I&#8217;m now the proud owner of one of these which will be going into the office tomorrow to replace my previous, rather dull, black mug).
