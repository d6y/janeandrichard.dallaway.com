I have a bit of a reputation in our office as being the [Google](http://www.google.com) Queen. Whenever anyone wants to know the answer to some unusual question, I crank up google and mostly find the answer. Because of this, I was asked to find the submission urls for various search engines so we could publicise our new [website](http://www.fluidnetwork.com). I found the submission forms on the big sites, and a few Free submission sites who submit your site to lots of search engines for you for free (we&#8217;re not interested in paying for submission at the moment, although we may go down that route later). One such site is [Submit Corner](http://www.submitcorner.com/) who seem to have a lot of search engines listed. I&#8217;ve given them a try and we&#8217;ll see how we get on.
