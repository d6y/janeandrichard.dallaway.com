I was emailed a job spec today from a company who used to have me on their books after I was made [redundant last year](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/11/well_survived_rounds_of) &#8211; among many other, very detailed, requirements they want &#8220;fluently trilingual&#8221;. But they don&#8217;t mention what languages! The job is in Brussels so I assume it&#8217;s English, French and Flemish but&#8230;. Could I apply with English, Yorkshire and Hull as my three languages that I can fluently converse in?
