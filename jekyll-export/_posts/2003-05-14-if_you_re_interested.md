If you&#8217;re interested in software licensing and copyright&#8230; ok, for those of you who are left, take a look at [Problems in Open Source Licensing](http://www.ilaw.com.au/public/licencearticle.html). It makes some useful comments on what you can and can&#8217;t do with copyright, and when you do and don&#8217;t have a contract. Note, it&#8217;s written from an Australian law point of view.
