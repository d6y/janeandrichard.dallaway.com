My [Sloppy](http://www.dallaway.com/sloppy/) project has a write-up in [PC-Pro](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/) magazine, issue 104 (June 2003, cover headline: &#8220;Can you ditch Microsoft&#8221;). Jump to page 207/208. One day you might see it in the [Real world](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/realworld/realworld_index.php) section of the magainze&#8217;s web site. But not for a month or so, I&#8217;d guess.
