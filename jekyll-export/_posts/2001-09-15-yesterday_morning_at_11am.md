Yesterday morning at 11am, England (and most of Europe) stopped for a 3 minute silence. I was at work and we all gathered on the 3rd floor and stood, heads bowed and reflected on the events of Tuesday (although to be honest, we&#8217;ve talked or thought about little else since it happened). On Tuesday afternoon, we had the radio on, a tv on further down the office, and mostly spent the afternoon getting all the information we could, always hoping that it was a mistake, or an exageration, or something, anything but that. It&#8217;s something that I think will take everyone a long time to come to terms with.

Our thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones, friends, colleagues and also those who have been working so hard to look for survivors.
