Yesterday I was in London for [Modular 2003](http://www.modular2003.com), which I think is fair to summarize as a conference for music geeks to talk shop. The photos are from the &#8220;Analog Modular Room Installation&#8221;, but I also managed to catch some interesting talks: [improvising swarms](http://www.discover.com/mar_03/feattech.html), artificial music, a demo from Clavia and [some whacky ideas for new instruments](http://www.tecn.upf.es/~sjorda/TSI1/SI6A_archivos/v3_slide0011.htm).
