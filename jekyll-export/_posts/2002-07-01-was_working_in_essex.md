I was working in Essex today, and at lunch time we jumped in the car and headed out. As you might imagine, the roads were busy. At one [roundabout](http://www.roundaboutsusa.com/intro.html) a driver had stopped across the roundabout blocking traffic. A breakdown, right? No. She was out of her car chasing a small rabbit back into the grassy central reservation. Isn&#8217;t that cute/insane [delete as applicable]
