It was my birthday yesterday, and I had a very nice day indeed thank you. Richard bought me lots of photography toys (a new tripod, and a couple of books [[1](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/071531274X/richarddallaway)],[[2](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0817437126/richarddallaway)]) which will keep me out of mischief, and I got some lovely presents from other friends and family.

We went out for dinner at the [Regency Restaurant](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/seafood/regency.html), which was pretty good, although [La Fourchette](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/french/la_fourchette.html) is still my favourite seafood restaurant. We then headed off to meet Jeremy for a drink at the [3JB](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/at_the_bar/threejollybutchers.html)s, probably the last time I&#8217;ll ever go there as their customer service was appaling &#8211; we ordered glasses of wine, which tasted like vinegar to us, and they then refused to replace them. All in all a good birthday (although less surprises than [last year](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622634902371/) :-).
