This morning has been a photo editing marathon. I&#8217;ve worked through the [photos of Calcutta](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/india2004/index.html) and have started the sorting of the photos of Neela and Ste&#8217;s wedding.

I had 307 wedding photos (excluding video) and have reduced this to 79 so far &#8211; so still some more culling to go before I have them finished.
