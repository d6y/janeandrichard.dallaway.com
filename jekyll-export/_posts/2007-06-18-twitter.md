Some of my non-Twitter friends are incredulous at my use of Twitter. I thought I&#8217;d better explain. 

I don&#8217;t think Twitter is anything like blogging (or microblogging). I don&#8217;t think of it as IM, although you sometimes get into IM-ish exchanges. What does it do?

Well, there have been a couple of interesting spontaneous group pub trips, although how spontaneous I don&#8217;t know because people go to the pub on a Friday night anyway. What I have found is that I&#8217;ve got a sense of getting to know people&#8212;people who I meet from time to time anyway but don&#8217;t normally get any kind of extended involvement with (weak ties, [Tipping Point](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0349113467?ie=UTF8&tag=richarddallaway&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0349113467) fans). And I&#8217;m enjoying that a great deal. This familiarization is almost certainly an illusion to some degree, because meatspace is so important for really getting to know someone. Perhaps it&#8217;s just another social lubrication. Like beer.
