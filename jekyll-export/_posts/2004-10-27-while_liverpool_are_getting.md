While Liverpool are [getting on with it](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/3758328.stm), we&#8217;re still talking about it: the [latest survey in Brighton](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/3956797.stm) say 80% favour a smoking ban in the city (n=3700). 

The government have pretty much ruled out a national ban for now, so this means Liverpool (and other councils) will need to ask [Parliament](http://www.parliament.uk) to implement local laws. In the case of Liverpool, it&#8217;s the Prohibition of Smoking in Places of Work Bill. I&#8217;ve not yet found the text of the bill, but it&#8217;ll probably be introduced as a Private Member&#8217;s Bill by the end of November. 

According to the [Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1324186,00.html) &#8220;many of England&#8217;s biggest cities and nearly 50 councils are lining up behind Liverpool to back a ban on smoking&#8221;. In fact, a join bill from the London boroughs will also be presented this year to allow any London borough to put in place a similar ban. With this sort of pressure surely there will eventually be national legislation.

For now, it&#8217;ll still take 12-18 months for the local laws to be passed. This might be one of those [fax your mp](http://www.faxyourmp.com/) moments.
