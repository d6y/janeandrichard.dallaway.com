On Saturday afternoon [Skitters](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/tag/skitters/) and I headed down to the walled garden (more properly known as the [Rest Garden](http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/212005)) to meet up with [Alex](http://www.alexandtheweb.com/) and [Dave](http://sheepfilms.co.uk/). Dave had an idea for a [short film](http://sheepfilms.co.uk/category/shortfilms/) for which he needed a dog. After a long discussion about her [rider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider_(theater)), Skitters agreed.

The finished film can be seen [here](http://sheepfilms.co.uk/2009/12/01/1806/) and is described as 

> Unfortunate sausage-based arm condition siezed upon by an opportunistic dog

He sent us through a version when he had just cut Skitters out but hadn&#8217;t removed her blue rubber ball, which I have to say I love ðŸ™‚
