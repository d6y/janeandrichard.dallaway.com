Lately with been to the [Tin Drum, Kemptown](http://www.tindrum.co.uk/kemptown_frame.html) (lovely starters, but dissapointing otherwise), [The Bayleaf](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/indian/bayleaf.html) (perfect Indian) and [Moshi Moshi](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/japanese/moshimoshi.html) (it&#8217;s a conveyor Sushi chain, but a good one).
