We recently had a week off and spent it exploring more of the UK. We started and ended our trip with visits to [snowboard shows](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2007/10/snowboard_shows) &#8211; the first at [Tamworth Snowdome](http://www.snowdome.co.uk/), the second at [Milton Keynes Xscape](http://www.xscape.co.uk/snow/milton-keynes/whats-inside/snowslope/). We figured it was time to explore more of the West/North West/Midlands and so based ourselves around there for the week.

We took the opportunity to stop off at Chatsworth and spent a very pleasant afternoon strolling around the [grounds](http://www.chatsworth.org/whattodo/garden.htm) and the [house](http://www.chatsworth.org/whattodo/house.htm). ([More photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157602248896148/)) . The &#8220;[Beyond Limits](http://www.chatsworth.org/whattodo/garden_sothebys.htm)&#8221; exhibition was a really interesting addition to the beautiful gardens, and [Damien Hirst&#8217;s Virgin Mary](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/1479240939/in/set-72157602248896148/) was really impressive. As a Girl Guide I visited the extended grounds of Chatsworth many times, camping on the grounds, staying in stone barns, but this was the first time I&#8217;d visited the house and gardens. It was a really lovely afternoon, and the cake in the cafe was wonderful too.

Our next stop was a couple of nights in Liverpool, a city I&#8217;d only visited once before for a University open day, and which Richard hadn&#8217;t visited at all. As Liverpool is to be the City of Culture next year, we thought now might be an interesting to visit as it prepares itself. It is definitely a work in progress at the moment, and the number of [cranes on the skyline](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/1526332262/in/set-72157602335321600/) is quite impressive. We felt obliged to visit the Beatles story exhibition, which entertained us for quite a few hours. We also visited the Tate which unfortunately for us was having a swap around to make room for the Turner Prize exhibitons. We were both surprised at how small a city it is, being really walkable and not requiring public transport to get around the major attractions. I found the architecture amazing, and it reminded me quite a bit of Hull, my home town. Both cities are ports, both were heavily bombed during the 2nd world war, both have some amazing maritime buildings. [More photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157602335321600/).

Then a fun few days in Wales staying at [Cae Gwyn Farm](http://www.caegwynfarm.co.uk/) an organic bed and breakfast found via the [Organic Holiday directory](http://www.organicholidays.co.uk/). We attempted to do some mountain biking, but couldn&#8217;t find an open rental shop. As usual, wherever we go, things are closed. Maybe we should go &#8220;in season&#8221; sometime :-). Still we managed to get some walks in, one [around](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2007/W20070927104358.kml) the [visitor centre](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6cqheq), a [longer one](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2007/W20070927120536.kml) around the [forest](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/recreation.nsf/LUWebDocsByKey/WalesGwyneddNoForestCoedyBreninCoedyBreninVisitorCentre) and one [in Barmouth on the beach](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2007/W20070927154716.kml) at low tide. and a [trip](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2007/W20070926143344.kml) on the [Snowdon Mountain railway](http://www.snowdonrailway.co.uk/).

A great trip, and a great opportunity to unwind.
