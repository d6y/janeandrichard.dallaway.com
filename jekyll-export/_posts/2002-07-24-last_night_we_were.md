Last night we were at [ecademy](http://www.ecademy.com/) in London to hear a talk by Jason Porter, one of the founders of [Friends reunited](http://www.friendsreunited.co.uk). He gave us [the history](http://www.friendsreunited.co.uk/FriendsReunited.ASP?WCI=Info), and a few facts: 10,000 people joining the site _per day_; they built the site in a couple of weeks (&#8220;and it shows&#8221;, heckled [Dave](http://www.hodgkinson.org)). But nothing really interesting. It would have been a wasted day if we hadn&#8217;t also been in town to meet up with some friends.
