I got an email from [Anders Jacobsen](http://www.jacobsen.no/anders/blog/) this morning, asking me to consider posting links to aid agencies for the Tsunami relief funds. In return he will give $1 to the British Red Cross. So, in the interest of helping raise some extra cash I&#8217;ve included the [html that he provided](http://www.jacobsen.no/anders/blog/archives/2005/01/02/webloggers_give_to_tsunami_victims_and_ill_give_too.html). 

**International aid organizations**:

  * [UNICEF](http://unicef.org/) (United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund)
  * [United Nations&#8217; World Food Programme](http://www.wfp.org/)
  * [Medecins Sans Frontieres / Doctors without Borders](http://www.msf.org/) ([donate!](http://www.msf.org/donations/index.cfm))
  * [CARE International](http://www.care.org/)

[Anders Jacobsen](http://www.jacobsen.no/anders/blog/): [Webloggers: Give to tsunami victims and I&#8217;ll give too!](http://www.jacobsen.no/anders/blog/archives/2005/01/02/webloggers_give_to_tsunami_victims_and_ill_give_too.html)

On a related note, I had an email from [Andy Budd](http://www.andybudd.com/) the other day about [BlogAid](http://www.blogaid.org.uk/) &#8211; he&#8217;s encouraging bloggers to pledge their income from the blog (through ads etc) to one of the relief funds.
