[British Eurosport](http://www.eurosport.com/home/pages/L2/S82/stories_Lng2_Spo82.shtml) are providing some great coverage of the Olympic games. I&#8217;m normally a BBC girl for sport, but they seem to be limited to showing mainly round-up programmes whereas British Eurosport are showing full events (although the [BBC weekend schedule](http://news.bbc.co.uk/winterolympics2002/hi/english/bbc_coverage/newsid_1766000/1766706.stm) looks better). Unfortunately, I seem to have mainly seen lots of cross country ski-ing and definitely haven&#8217;t seen enough luge yet.
