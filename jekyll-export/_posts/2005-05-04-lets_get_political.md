I was endeavouring to be fair to [all parties](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/html/96.stm) and so kept all the [bumf](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=bumf) that we&#8217;ve received through the letter box. The end result of this is that I can&#8217;t be bothered to read it all, and so have decided to count them instead. Not sure what this tells us, but the honour of &#8220;Most leaflets&#8221; must be shared between the [Conservative Party](http://www.mikeweatherley.org.uk/) and the [Green Party.](http://www.keithforwestminster.com/h/f/KEITH/blog//2//)
