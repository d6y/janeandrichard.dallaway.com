I found a perfect Christmas present for [Jono](http://www.jonoabroad.com) today &#8211; it was a cuddly moose in our local Safeway, with a Christmas hat saying &#8220;Merry X-Moose&#8221; on it&#8217;s jumper. But seeing as how a) we brought him a moose finger puppet back from our honeymoon, and b) he&#8217;s leaving the country on the 28th for good üôÅ it didn&#8217;t seem worth buying for him. So, instead, he&#8217;ll have to make do with [this](http://www.millan.net/funp/20/xmoose.html).
