Well, that was fun. I&#8217;ve just got back from 10 days in California. Richard headed out a little over 2 weeks ago for the [JavaOne conference](http://javaoneonline.mentorware.net/servlet/mware.servlets.LoginServlet?subsysId=2000) (more on that later probably) and then I flew out to meet him to make a holiday of it. We spent the weekend in San Francisco, before hiring a car and heading off to Lake Tahoe for a couple of days, on to the Napa Valley (wine country) and finishing off driving around Marin County. (I even queued in a book store at midnight on Friday to get my (hideously overpriced) [Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747551006/richarddallaway) &#8211; still it made excellent plane reading ðŸ™‚

Now I&#8217;ve just got to process the 500 or so [photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622634543611/)&#8230;
