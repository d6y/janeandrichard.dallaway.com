Yesterday I had a text from [Heather](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/surprise/img_1699_640/) saying that she was going to be appearing in Hove Crown Court (she&#8217;s a barrister) and were we around for a coffee. I was and so after she&#8217;d done her barrister stuff, Heather and I met up for a coffee, and then we toddled off to Lucy&#8217;s for lunch (where Richard joined us) and then we decided to head to the [Grand](http://www.grandbrighton.co.uk/) for a bottle of champagne before Heather had to head off back to London. One of those &#8220;it just happened&#8221; kind of afternoons. Lovely.
