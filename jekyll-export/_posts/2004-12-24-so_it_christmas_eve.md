So, it&#8217;s Christmas Eve and all is well. All our food has arrived from the various internet-order places (organic vegetables from [Riverford](http://www.riverford.co.uk/en/), meats from [Welsh Farm Organics](http://www.welshfarmorganics.co.uk/) and a turkey breast joint from [Kelly Turkeys](http://www.kelly-turkeys.com/)). All that remains is for me to get cooking.
