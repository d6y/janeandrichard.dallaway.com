You can&#8217;t expect to win against [rock orcs](http://www.eurovision.tv/english/index.htm), but I&#8217;d thought the [German entry](http://www.eurovision.tv/english/384.htm) would do better than it did at Eurovision. There&#8217;s something exceptional about a [German country music act](http://www.texaslightning.net/). They got my vote.
