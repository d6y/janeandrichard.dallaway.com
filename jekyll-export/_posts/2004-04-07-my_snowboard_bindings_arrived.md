My snowboard bindings arrived yesterday, and very pleased I am too. I originally ordered some special &#8220;lady&#8221; [flow](http://www.flow.com/) bindings, but despite [Robin Hood Watersports](http://www.roho.co.uk/snowboard/index.html) saying they had them to sell, they later emailed me to say they didn&#8217;t. üôÅ So, I opted for some Pro 11 flow&#8217;s from [edge2edge](http://www.edge2edge.co.uk/acatalog/Edge_2_Edge_Online-NEW_SNOWBOARDS-SNOWBOARD_BINDING.html). I bought them when they were still at full price, but they sold them at their sale price &#8211; so I got &#xA3;35 off them. Thank you [edge2edge](http://www.edge2edge.co.uk/) üòÄ

This evening we attached our bindings to our boards (with not too much difficulty)- we just need to find some snow now&#8230;
