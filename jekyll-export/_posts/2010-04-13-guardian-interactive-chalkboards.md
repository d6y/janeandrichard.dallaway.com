Thanks to [Information Aesthetics](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2010/04/guardian_interactive_chalkboards_map_and_share_soccer_games.html) for pointing me at the [Guardian Interactive Chalkboards](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chalkboards/) on-line application to look at the in-depth analysis of my favourite premier league team. <figure id="attachment_1485" style="width: 627px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Look, Hull City did have some shots against Burnley the other day, some were even on target. Its just a shame that this is Premier League only, and its unlikely I&#8217;ll be able to use it to view Hull City&#8217;s stats next year üôÅ
