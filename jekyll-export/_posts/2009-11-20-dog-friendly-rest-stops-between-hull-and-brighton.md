Last weekend we visited my parents in Hull.  Rather than breaking the journey up at Motorway Services we planned in stops at places which had dog-walking potential. So, armed with a road atlas, and an idea that we wanted to stop between Cambridge and Peterborough, we identified and tried a couple of spots which were only just off the route we travel.

**Graftham Water**

We stopped at [Graftham Water](http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/leisure/what-to-see/water-parks/grafham/) on our way up to Hull on Friday afternoon.  From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafham_Water):

> Grafham Water (TL 150 680) is a reservoir with a circumference of about 10 miles (16 km). It is located between the villages of Grafham and Perry in the English county of Cambridgeshire (Huntingdonshire District).

We parked in the car park near Perry, paid our £2, made use of the amenities (toilets, cafe etc) and managed a [reasonable walk](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/13-Nov-09_14_40_GrafthamWater.kml)

**Monks Wood**

On the return trip we stopped at Monks Wood. From [Natural England](http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nnr/1006103.aspx):

> Monks Wood NNR is one of the best examples of ancient ash-oak woodland in the East Midlands.

There is no car park as such, but there is parking in a layby off the B1090. There are also no amenities. But, there are a couple of marked walks &#8211; we followed [Butterfly](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2009/15-Nov-09_14_07_ButterflyWalkMonksWood.kml) amongst all the trees, stopping for a spot of dog distraction training (lots of interesting smells that a certain young dog was fixated by).

So, 2 very different walks, both much better places to stop than at a Service station. The amenities at Graftham Water were really good but cost us £2 for parking whilst the walk was better at Monks Wood, we got free parking but had to stop at a Little Chef for toilets and cafe.
