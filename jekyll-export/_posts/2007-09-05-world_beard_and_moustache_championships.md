On Saturday, the [World Beard and Moustache Championships](http://www.handlebarclub.co.uk/wbmc.shtml) were held at the Brighton Centre. 

The event started, for the public (and for us thanks to a [tip off](http://twitter.com/andybudd/statuses/240753362) from [Andy](http://andybudd.com/)) with a parade from the town hall, through the lanes to the Brighton Centre before starting for proper an hour or so later. Prior to the event starting, I thought it would all be a bit of a joke, but I hadn&#8217;t been prepared for the sheer amount of effort that people had gone to, especially their costumes. As if growing a large amount of facial fur wasn&#8217;t enough, at least one guy had painted himself silver for the occasion.

We met up with friends and headed off and the girls watched the &#8216;tache competition whilst the boys spend an hour (yes really) queueing for beer at the bar (which had 5 members of staff serving for 2,300 people &#8211; nice). After finally getting our beer we sat down in comfort for the freestyle moustache and the partial beard categories. Jeremy, Kirsty and Rory headed home mid way through partial beards, and we spotted Dom, Fiona and Amelia and so went and watched a few more rounds with them before deciding we were all bearded out and needed to head home.

There are, of course, [more photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157601797422522/) to be perused. The next championships is in 2 years time in Alaska, somehow I don&#8217;t expect we&#8217;ll be attending.<br clear="all" />
