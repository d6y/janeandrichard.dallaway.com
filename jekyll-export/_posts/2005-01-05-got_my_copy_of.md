I got my copy of the [SkiClub](http://www.skiclub.co.uk/skiclub/default.asp) magazine yesterday, and it had a feature on [MountMaps](http://www.mountmaps.com/main.asp) which look like quite a handy evolution in ski maps &#8211; 3D representations of ski terrain. Currently they&#8217;ve got maps of the Three Valleys, SkiWelt, Whistler and Big White. If they had them for any of the places we&#8217;re visiting this year (Fernie, Kimberley and Panorama) I&#8217;d probably buy one to see how they work in the wild.
