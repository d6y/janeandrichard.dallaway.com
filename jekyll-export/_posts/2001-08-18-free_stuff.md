A school friend of mine, Steve, sent me an email during the week about the [British Freebies](http://www.britishfreebies.co.uk/) web site. It maintains a list of websites which give away free things &#8211; like [cinema tickets](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/djs/movie_lounge_form.shtml), [disposable cameras](http://www.fotango.com/freecamls.html), [A school friend of mine, Steve, sent me an email during the week about the [British Freebies](http://www.britishfreebies.co.uk/) web site.

I had a quick look on Tuesday and sent off for my free &#8220;[Window on the UK 2000](http://www.bnsc.org/wouk/html/cdroms/index.htm)&#8221; CD. It arrived today and it&#8217;s really interesting. It&#8217;s a collection of images taken from space, and aircrafts during 1999 and seems to have pictures covering most of the UK to some level or other. They have some very clear and high resolution pictures of London, and they were obviously taken whilst both the Dome and the London Eye were under construction. Interesting stuff!
