After taking a couple of mountain bikes for a test ride ([The Bike Chain](http://www.yhaadventure.co.uk/html/bike.htm) at YHA Adventure still do this &#8211; you leave a piece of photo id and a credit card and they&#8217;ll let you take your prospective new bikes out. Fantastic service) we walked down to Marine Parade to watch the cars arriving in the London to Brighton Vintage car rally. A wide selection of old cars take part in this rally, and some of them seemed to manage the drive better than others &#8211; one seemed to give up around 20 metres from the finish line.
