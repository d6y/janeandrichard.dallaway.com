I [mentioned a few weeks ago](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/09/couch_to_5k) that I&#8217;d taken up running. Since that post I&#8217;ve managed to run 5K on a couple of occasions, and I&#8217;ve also done some interval training. I&#8217;ve decided to enter a [3.8K race on the 9th November 2008](http://www.brightonphoenix.org.uk/phoenixraces.asp) in Preston Park, Brighton and this seems like a great opportunity to raise some money for the [Alzheimers society](http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/index.php). As most of my friends know my Mum was diagnosed with dementia in November 2001 and I know firsthand how hard this illness can be for both the patient and the friends and family who watch the slow decline in brain function. This is the first time I&#8217;ve blogged about this, and my main reason now is to ask you to [sponsor me](http://www.justgiving.com/janedallaway). I make no promises about the speed I&#8217;ll do the run &#8211; the course record is under 12 minutes, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be causing the record holder any worries &#8211; finishing it will be achievement enough for me.
