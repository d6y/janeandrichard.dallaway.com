I&#8217;ve just finished reading [The Salmon of Doubt](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/books/reviews/rich/salmon.xml). I&#8217;m not much interested in unfinished novels, but it was great to read some Douglas Adams one more time &#8212; and actually, the bulk of the book is a collection of magazine articles, newspaper articles and interviews.

&#8221;

The annoying thing is there&#8217;s not going to be any more, what with him being dead and all. I&#8217;m so glad I saw him speak. I thought it was at the
  
[Turing 1990 Colloquium](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/idom/irlist/new/1990/90-vii-9-15/Turing_1990_Colloquium,_April_3-6,_1990,_England.html), April 6 1990, held at the University of Sussex campus (which I went to and got the t-shirt). But I think it was more likely to have been the
  
 [Computers And Writing](http://lists.village.virginia.edu/lists_archive/Humanist/v04/0998.html) conference, also held on campus on March 23, 1991. I don&#8217;t think I would have gone to that conference, but I guess I would have found a way to get in to see Douglas Adams talk. From what I remember Adams was supposed to talk about user interfaces, but twisted it into something from [Last Chance to See](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/books/reviews/jane/lastchancetosee.xml). And yes it was very entertaining.
