Having gathered together all the information I need to fill in my tax return for 2001/02 online &#8211; mostly I&#8217;ve been waiting for the [Inland Revenue](http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk) to send me a username for the site &#8211; I was somewhat concerned to read that this facility has been withdrawn &#8220;whilst we are carrying out system assurance checks&#8221; ([apparently users could view other users tax returns](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/23/25522.html) &#8211; doh!). Guess I&#8217;ll have to wait until they fix the problem.
