So, [Hull City have finally got their man Phil Parkinson](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/5129748.stm). He has cost the club &#xA3;400,000 in compensation to Colchester, but at least &#xA3;300,000 of that came [from Crystal Palace for Peter Taylor](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/5067262.stm).
