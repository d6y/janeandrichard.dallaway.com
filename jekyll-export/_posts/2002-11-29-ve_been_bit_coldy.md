I&#8217;ve been a bit coldy and coughy all this week, and so have been tucked up at home for most of it. Some of the time working, some of the time sleeping and taking it easy. One thing I have been doing though, is watching Celebrity Big Brother. It&#8217;s been good fun at times (apart from watching them sewing that damn patchwork quilt which was just \*so\* dull) but yesterday our fav left &#8211; [Sue Perkins](http://www.melandsue.co.uk/). Admittedly, she was our favourite before she went in, but that didn&#8217;t change during the week or so that she was in the house for. During the &#8220;post [eviction](http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_718225.html)&#8221; interview last night on Channel 4 Davina showed a clip from a breakfast tv show when they&#8217;d been doing a vote about Melinda &#8211; was she more like Darth Vader (as [Goldie had said](http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/021125/128/dfdts.html)) or Vulcan (as Sue had said)? The vote said she was more Sith. The thought of some breakfast tv show doing this poll just really made me giggle.
