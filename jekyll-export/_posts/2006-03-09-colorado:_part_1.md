Those people who have travelled with me know that I&#8217;m the one who tends to get &#8220;extra attention&#8221; when going through security. On our way out to Colorado my bag spent quite a lot of time in the x-ray machine. Security personnel explained that I was carrying a pair of scissors. Not a little pair of nail scissors, but a big pair. This was a shock, as I was pretty sure I hadn&#8217;t done something that dumb, but I started to doubt myself when people armed with big scanning technology forcefully insisted that in fact I did, and I&#8217;d have to hang around for a search. The way she said it implied that I really should know better, and that they see people like me _all the time_, and although clearly not a terrorist, I shouldn&#8217;t even bother to try to fool them, or expect to get something as obvious as scissors through security, I mean who do I think I am, and what was I thinking, wasting valuable time, and frankly I should be ejected from the airport now, as a simpleton, and have my airport privileges removed for life. Hmmm&#8230;yes, that about captures her tone. 

There were no scissors in my bag. The security guy swabbing my bag (in that &#8220;I&#8217;m just checking your bag as an objective and open-minded observer, but I know you&#8217;re hiding something&#8221; way they do) was very surprised. I wonder who&#8217;s bag they mistook mine for, and which flight the big scissors went on?

Which all reminds me: Apologies to my fellow traveller yesterday, a lady at Gatwick North security, who I punched in the forehead while I was putting my jacket back on. 

But&#8230;Colorado. It&#8217;s a remarkable place. Arriving at Denver you see what appears to be the flattest expanse of land anywhere, but turn around and&#8230; wow! There are The Rockies. At this point, I didn&#8217;t feel any different, but Denver itself is already 1.6km above sea level, and some of the places we were visiting were [getting on for 4km](http://breckenridge.snow.com/info/winter/newlift.asp) up. As a result some shortness of breath and [other problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness) followed. But nothing serious. It does, however, explain why supermarkets stock oxygen.
