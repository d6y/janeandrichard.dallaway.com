There are [sand sculptures in Brighton](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4672583.stm) apparently as part of a summer-long [sand sculpture festival](http://www.flickr.com/photos/inaxi-sculptures/sets/544337/). I think we&#8217;ll have to head off down and take a look later in the week.

Update &#8211; found some better [photos](http://inaxi.com/gallery2/view_album.php?set_albumName=2005-brighton).
