The Christmas edition of the Economist ran a feature on [human evolution](http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5299220). I found one of the sections in particular quite interesting: [the suggestion](http://www.cogsci.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/psyc/newpsy?12.008) that the brain is like a peacock&#8217;s tail. That&#8217;s to say, it&#8217;s a over-the-top demonstration of the owner&#8217;s genetic fitness. It&#8217;s clear that brains are expensive (2% of the body, using 20% of the energy intake) and there are a bunch of things we do which it could be argued don&#8217;t help us survive, but might help us mate: dancing, painting, music, language. 

The article caused me to remember the book [The Christmas edition of the Economist ran a feature on [human evolution](http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5299220).

The article caused me to remember the book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0586090452/richarddallaway) . One idea in that novel is that brains&#8212;when they get to a certain size&#8212;are more trouble than they&#8217;re worth. The evidence offered to support this is the fact we spent so much time trying to silence our brains with alcohol ðŸ™‚
