Further to [an earlier blog](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/04/and_in_other_news) about the fire at Center Parcs, a [BBC news report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/england/newsid_1932000/1932682.stm) is saying that the Suffolk Fire Service have released a report which says that contractors working on a roof caused the [fire](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/england/newsid_1911000/1911258.stm) to start, and that it spread too quickly for Center Parcs own Firefighters to deal with it.

Still haven&#8217;t heard anything about our weekend in June yet, but seeing as how the BBC report says &#8220;Rebuilding work at the centre is likely to take several months to complete&#8221; I&#8217;m not hopeful about it.
