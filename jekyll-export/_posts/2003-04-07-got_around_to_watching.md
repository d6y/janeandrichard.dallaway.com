I got around to watching a programme that [Tivo](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/tivo.xml) had recorded for us a month or so ago about [Lomography](http://www.lomography.com/). It was really interesting, and I especially like the [Rules](http://www.lomography.com/content/about/rules/dbl.php?wr=01) for photography. No 1: Take your camera everywhere you go. Last time I did this was with my [eyemodule](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/eyemodule.xml) [[photos](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/eyemodule/)]. Hmm, sometimes I wonder whether I should have 2 sets of camera equipment, one for &#8220;shoots&#8221; and one just to carry around with me. or maybe I should just invest in a [camera phone like Richard](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/p800.xml)&#8216;s?

I&#8217;m especially taken with the [supersampler](http://shop.lomography.com/orbiz/DigiTrade/e519fdf1b3fa05ec021e303d5233c11c4a26fa4e98ae2703ab1b8b92d46e254c/supersampler/super_frame.html) [shots](http://archive.lomography.com/archive/mysqlworldarchive/index4.php?i=0&name=&hometown=&i_shot_state=&i_shot_town=&i_title=&i_shot_content=&i_shot_country_id=&i_shot_kategory_id=&i_shot_color_id=&i_cam_id=5&submit=Search) as this is a really interesting concept.
