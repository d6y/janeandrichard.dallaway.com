I did quite a bit of work on my [family tree](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/tree/index.html) years ago and bought a copy of [Family Tree Maker](http://www.familytreemaker.com/FTM16.aspx) at the time. Since then I&#8217;ve installed it on machine after machine until now, when I have a mac and don&#8217;t want to install parallels just to run a very old version of FTW. Instead I downloaded a copy of [MacFamilyTree](http://www.onlymac.de/html/stammbaum4en.html) which is quite a pleasant application, and works well with the GED file exported from FTW, but seems to be short on a couple of useful features whilst still in demo mode, and until I know what those features are like I don&#8217;t particularly want to spend $50.

Yesterday [Aral twittered about Geni](http://twitter.com/aral/statuses/119930742) and Richard quickly sent me the [link](http://www.geni.com/). It looks like quite a nice way to get a quick visualisation of your family tree, and is very usable, allowing you to invite other members of your family to contribute. Unfortunately for me there is no way to [import GEDCOM files](http://forum.geni.com/topic.php?id=14&page) yet and until then it won&#8217;t become a usable solution as I&#8217;m not about to retype 150 or so peoples data in. Sigh!
