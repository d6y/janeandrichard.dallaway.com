A while ago I spotted a new book by [Fi Glover](http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/figlover/figlover.shtml) in a &#8220;2 for &#163;10&#8221; offer at a book stop. Given that I liked her [previous book](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/books/reviews/rich/oiltanker.xml) (and [so did](/books/reviews/jane/oiltanker.xml) Jane), I figured this would be more of the same and bought it.

&#8221;

Last week, I was about to begin a two-and-a-half hour train journey across Ireland. I opened the book and thought &#8220;Hmm&#8230; this looks familiar&#8221;. Turns out the publishers had slapped on some new cover art and changed the title from &#8220;I am an oil tanker&#8221; to &#8220;Travels with my radio&#8221;. Other than that, it&#8217;s exactly the same book. Bah. 

So, when it comes to impulse purchases in book shops, just say no. And when embarking on a long train journey across Ireland, make sure you have a [back up book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864503793/richarddallaway).
