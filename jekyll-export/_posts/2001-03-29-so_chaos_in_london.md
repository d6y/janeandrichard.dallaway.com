So, chaos in London today as the RMT union members strike for better safety on the underground. The [Transport for London site](http://www.transportforlondon.gov.uk) has this helpful message &#8220;Due to Industrial Action, Tube services throughout London are severley disrupted.&#8221; Meanwhile, [thetube.com](http://www.thetube.com/) has a more helpful page indicating what services are running.

So, I got a train from Ealing Broadway to Paddington and then walked from there to work at Chancery Lane. It&#8217;s about 3 miles and took about an hour. It wasn&#8217;t too bad, not something I&#8217;d choose to do everyday, but at least it was dry and sunny and not too cold.

It was quite entertaining watching people take to the streets, with cycles, micro scooters, roller blades and on foot. I passed many people with maps in their hands, some looked as if they&#8217;d bought A-Z maps especially as the mapbooks looked very clean and new.
