This one is probably a bit sad, but here goes anyway. If you wanted to fly around Mars (hypothetically), you&#8217;d get in an aircraft and&#8230;fly. Right? Turns out that it&#8217;s a bit more tricky. Although the laws of physics are the same, the parameters mean that [&#8220;all airplanes on Mars are airborne Titanics&#8221;](http://www.x-plane.com/mars.html).
