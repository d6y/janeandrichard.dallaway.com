This was the first place we stayed on our [BigTrip](/tag/bigtrip08/)

We&#8217;d done a lot of internet research on Oregon, and spent quite a lot of time looking for a log cabin to stay in. Eventually we found [Pappy&#8217;s cabin](http://www.mthoodwedding.com/), in Welches, and we based ourselves there for a week.

The cabin is on the banks of the river, and is down what is little more than a dirt track so was totally peaceful and a great place to relax. It is a short drive to 3 ski resorts&#8212;[Timberline](http://www.timberlinelodge.com/), [Mount Hood Meadows](http://www.skihood.com/) and [Mount Hood Skibowl](http://www.skibowl.com/)&#8212;and we visited them all during our week, as well as having a day off to investigate nearby Portland. It was lovely coming back each night to a well equipped cabin with a cozy wood-burning stove. 

We even had fresh snow on our first day.

Our favourite resorts were Timberline and Mount Hood Skibowl: Timberline, as its name suggests, has lots of trees and I love snowboarding through tree runs, and Skibowl has night skiing, lots and lots of it and snowboarding at night in fresh snow was great fun.

A great week, and a place I&#8217;d love to return to sometime.
