We were bored so we caught up on a back-log of [Frasier](http://www.nbc.com/Frasier/about/index.html)&#8216;s we had to watch. It&#8217;s still good, but it&#8217;s not a must watch any more, hence the accumulation. Anyway&#8230; one thing that struck me about a couple of the episodes was the terrible, terrible product placement. They had a [Segway](http://www.segway.com/) in one episode and a [Aibo](http://www.aibo.com/) in another. They were in the show for no reason at all, and did nothing for the story. I prefer to take my product placement in a more subtile, subliminal way, thanks. For the Segway or an Aibo I&#8217;d happily sit and watch a 30 minute infomercial. No need to &#8220;sneek&#8221; them into a show like Frasier.
