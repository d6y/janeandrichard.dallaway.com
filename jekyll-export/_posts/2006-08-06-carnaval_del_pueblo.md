We had every intention of spending Sunday at [Fruitstock](http://www.fruitstock.co.uk/), but it didn&#8217;t happen. We jumped on the train and headed off to see [Heather](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq-sD_wZZ1M), and Heather&#8217;s pad in SE17, and we thought we&#8217;d then go over to Fruitstock. But it turned out there was a festival just down the road from her in Burgess Park. It seemed only right and proper to check it out, so we ended up spending the day at [Carnaval del Pueblo](http://www.carnavaldelpueblo.co.uk) (&#8220;the largest Latin American event in Europe&#8221;). A couple of beers, lots of food and lots of food choice, four stages&#8230; yeah, it&#8217;s a good good thing.
