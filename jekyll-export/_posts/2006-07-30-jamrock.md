We played tourist yesterday, and decided to head out for dinner on a Saturday evening. Our first choice, [Due South](http://principiagastronomica.com/post/15), was fully booked so we decided to wander along the seafront and into town. I spotted that Louis Beach cafe had a sign out saying that they now do [Jamaican and Carribean food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_cuisine), so we thought we&#8217;d stop by and take a look. One portion of [Jamaican Jerk chicken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_chicken), one of ackee and saltfish and a side order of [plantain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantain) and we were very happy people. They don&#8217;t have an alcohol license, but the [Fortune of War](http://ultimatepubguide.com/pubs/info.phtml?pub_id=176) is within staggering distance. We had a great evening, eating tasty food, looking out to sea.
