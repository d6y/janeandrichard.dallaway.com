I made my first [bagels](http://www.pastrywiz.com/archive/whatisa.htm) yesterday &#8211; and they turned out to be a success. We&#8217;ve had a [bread maker](http://www.morphyrichards.co.uk/index.pl?REFID=7cffHHj5tY0ccA58TY7x67999%t7BYq7FTy600wrwtfp8oeusjjei54548ertytsafgw47&ORPGM=productOverview&ORPGT=perl&ORPRD=48285&ORGRP=R12&ORCAT=SR01&ORLID=ENG) for 2 years now, and have progressed from [pre-mixed bread-mixes](http://www.wrightsflour.co.uk/pages/clubnew/breadmachine.htm), through the [recipes that came with the machine](http://www.morphyrichards.co.uk/wizz400/downloads/InstructionBooklets/IB48285.PDF), to those in a [recently bought book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/202-1190729-4960659). Yesterday I attempted my first &#8220;internet&#8221; bread recipe &#8211; [for bagels](http://recipeview.com/Bagels/Bagels2.htm). I had to adjust the recipe slightly as I didn&#8217;t have any Barley malt syrup or Molasses &#8211; so I just put them in plain boiling water. They also floated the moment I put them in, but [this recipe](http://www.recipe-ideas.co.uk/recipes-1/Bagels%20(Breadmaker).htm) suggests &#8220;cooking for about 30 seconds on each side&#8221; which is similar to how long I boiled them.
