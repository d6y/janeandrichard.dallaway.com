The [NSPCC](http://www.nspcc.org.uk/html/homepage/home.htm) are running a [Donate-4-Free](http://www.nspcc.org.uk/donate-4-free/) service on their website. All you have to do is Click on the big green button that says &#8220;Click Here&#8221; and 4p will be donated to the NSPCC on your behalf. There is a Terms and Conditions notice which says that it will only work if you&#8217;re within the EU.
