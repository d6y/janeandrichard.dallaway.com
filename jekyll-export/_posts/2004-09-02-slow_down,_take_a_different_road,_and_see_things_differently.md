[Wired](http://www.wired.com/) had a [story yesterday](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64776,00.html) about a guy [Segwaying across the US](http://www.10mph.com/). Another mad scheme. This one seems to be being done to make a documentary out of &#8211; rather than just because they can as he counts a &#8220;Writer and independent filmmaker&#8221; amongst his 4 strong [support team](http://www.10mph.com/about/team.html) and their [plan](http://www.10mph.com/about/) states &#8220;And when we&#8217;re finished, we&#8217;ll wrap it up with a feature-length documentary.&#8221; This still counts as an adventure in my books though!

Meanwhile, my friends [Vic and Banz](http://www.bigtrip.blogspot.com) and their friends [Spencer and Cath](http://www.oztrip04.blogspot.com/) continue to make good progress in their respective world trips &#8211; both sets are travelling from the UK to Australia &#8211; Vic and Banz by [bi](http://www.bigtrip.blogspot.com/logistics/sob.html)[ke](http://www.bigtrip.blogspot.com/logistics/sos.html), Spencer and Cath in a more [traditional](http://oztrip04.blogspot.com/backpack/backpacks.html) way.
