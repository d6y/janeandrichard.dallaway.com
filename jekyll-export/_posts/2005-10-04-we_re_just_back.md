We&#8217;re just back from a lovely week in Cornwall. We rented a [lovely cottage](http://www.farmcott.co.uk/search/showproperty.asp_Q_propertyID_E_560) near Bude.

&#8221;

Highlights of the trip were a day spent at the [Eden Project](http://www.edenproject.com/), [fish and chips](http://www.rickstein.com/restaurants_steinsfishandchips.htm) from Rick Stein&#8217;s in Padstow (best fish and chips ever) and the [Porthcurno Telegraph Museum](http://www.porthcurno.org.uk/).

I haven&#8217;t sorted out the photographs yet, but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be some soon&#8230;
