One of the photos I took of the [West Pier fire](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_03_28/) is on the BBC web site as part of their &#8220;[Taken a good picture lately?](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/2780295.stm#)&#8221; set for the week of [29 March &#8211; 4 April](javascript: void window.open('http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/03/uk_your_perspective_on_the_world0_29_march_-_4_april_2003/html/1.stm', '1049374707', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=400,left=312,top=100');). Take a look at it [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/03/uk_your_perspective_on_the_world0_29_march_-_4_april_2003/html/2.stm). I&#8217;m really rather pleased about that, although it&#8217;s a bit odd that they didn&#8217;t email me to tell me, I just happened to take a look and saw it.
