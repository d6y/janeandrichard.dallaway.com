This afternoon we spent a couple of hours at [The Werks](http://www.werkshop.org.uk/space/) watching the highlights of the [NaVloPoMo](http://nablopomo.ning.com/group/videobloggers) 2007 project. Some of the films were funny, some were sad, a lot were well thought out with a story to tell.

I used the video feature on my phone and recorded snippets of the afternoon, which I&#8217;ve edited in iMovie as a tribute.

I don&#8217;t think I should give up the [photography](http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/) and switch to video any time soon :-). Having said that [Node 101](http://node101.pbwiki.com/) is a skill swap style idea to help people learn how to produce video, so if it gets off the ground in Brighton, maybe I should head along.
