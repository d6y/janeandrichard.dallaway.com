Well done Ireland. We&#8217;ve just been listening to the Ireland v Saudi Arabia game on [Radio 5](http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive) in the office and it&#8217;s been a great game to listen to. I&#8217;m planning on watching the highlights on the tv later tonight. Now, I just want England to do the same tomorrow and get through to the second round as well. Come on England.
