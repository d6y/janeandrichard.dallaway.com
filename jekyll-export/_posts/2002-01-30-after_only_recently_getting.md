After only recently getting into &#8220;Stargate: SG-1&#8221;, today we learn that there&#8217;s going to be a movie ([Stargate II](http://www.scifiguide.net/stargate/movies/02.shtml)) featuring the cast of SG-1. Hurrah. But&#8230; they won&#8217;t be making any more SG-1s after series six. Boo. But there will be a spin-off series, called [Stargate Atlantis](http://www.scifiguide.net/stargate/news/spinoffnews.shtml). So all is not lost, and anyway&#8230; as we&#8217;re only just watching series 1, we&#8217;ve got a lot of catching up to do.
