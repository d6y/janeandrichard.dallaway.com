We went to [La Fourchette](http://www.lafourchette.co.uk/) last night for the first time since it&#8217;s moved. The food was as good as ever, although the blackboard full of fish/seafood choices has been replaced with a printed menu with slightly less choices. The service was excellent, and the atmosphere pleasant although it was a bit cramped (a couple too many tables). All in all, we&#8217;ll go back&#8230; again!
