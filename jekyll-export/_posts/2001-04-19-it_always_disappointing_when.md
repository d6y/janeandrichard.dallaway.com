It&#8217;s always disappointing when you see a different road sign, but then don&#8217;t see the thing
  
you&#8217;re being warned against &#8212; rock slide, flood, falling rocks&#8230; or tank crossing signs like this one, taken someplace around Salisbury Plain.
   
Still it&#8217;s good that we have the signs because if you were driving down a country road and turned a corner to find, without warning, a tank in the middle of the road you&#8217;d probably be surprised.
