Tuesday, at [&#163;5 App](http://fivepoundapp.com/), [Glenn](http://www.glennjones.net) gave his personal view of the history of his [company](http://madgex.com/): _The idea, name, table football, money, cake and the culture_. The most interesting parts for me were his description of using scale to escape the for hire rollercoster (if you&#8217;re working as an agency), the importance of having a shared set of values, and using money as a tool. 

Interesting stuff. It&#8217;ll take a while for it to sink in for me, but as [Ribot](http://www.ribot.co.uk/) caught [the talk on video (part 1)](http://qik.com/video/51892) (and [part 2](http://qik.com/video/51913)) you can judge for yourself.
