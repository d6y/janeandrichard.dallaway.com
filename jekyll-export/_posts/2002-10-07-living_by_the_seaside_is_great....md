&#8230;because it means that since we [moved to our new office](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/08/today_is_office_move) I can go for a walk along the seafront at lunch time. And at lunch time there aren&#8217;t many people around at this end of the promenade (near Hove Lagoon) and so it&#8217;s peaceful and all you can hear is the noise of the sea. It&#8217;s great for people watching too. Today there was a guy wearing just a pair of shorts fishing, a couple sitting on a bench making their lunch (bread, butter, cucumber for sandwiches), a lady coming back from a swim, a guy painting his beach hut and other people just wandering along.
