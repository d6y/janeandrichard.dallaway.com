We went to see [Calendar Girls](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337909/) last night, and were very amused by it. I took a look at the [official site](http://calendargirls.movies.go.com/) this morning and am really amused by the amount of air brushing that has gone on with the [main picture](http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/60/15/53m.jpg)&#8230; I mean, really, the idea of this film is that a group of wrinklies get their kit off for a charity calendar &#8211; it&#8217;s not meant to be that glam.
