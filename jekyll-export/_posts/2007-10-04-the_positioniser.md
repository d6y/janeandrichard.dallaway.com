Have you read [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)? Yeah, me too. It&#8217;s great, isn&#8217;t it? I found it really kicked me over the edge in appreciating the capabilities of getting information across to people in graphs.

Now, the graph below breaks a whole bunch of rules: way too much ink, and.. hello!&#8230; what&#8217;s that spurious bell curve doing there? But it&#8217;s still one hell of a useful diagram.

[<img src="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/blog/2007/10/boardguide2007thumb.jpg" width="450" height="308" alt="Diagram showing the position of snowboards against suitability and price" />](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/blog/2007/10/boardguide2007hilight.jpg)

What I love about the diagram is the way it allows you to hunt-and-peck regions to find boards you might want to try out. For example, it tells me that I need to be over to the left next time I try any boards out.

The diagram is called The Positioniser(TM) and is from last year&#8217;s [Document Snowboard](http://www.fall-line-media.com/snow/) magazine&#8217;s Ultimate Gear Guide supplement (it&#8217;s my second favourite snowboard magazine, after [Snowboard UK](http://www.sukmag.com/), but the supplement rocks).
