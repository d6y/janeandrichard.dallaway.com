Whilst staying with my parents over the weekend we visited [Filey](http://www.discoveryorkshirecoast.com/filey_welcome.asp), a place I hadn&#8217;t been to for many years. It was a pretty cold, blustery day but we managed a walk along the sea front and spotted this water feature based on a maritime compass which is part of Filey&#8217;s [art and craft scene](http://www.discoveryorkshirecoast.com/content/what_to_do/filey/fy_art_and_craft.asp) and which I primarily noticed because of Richard&#8217;s obsession with the [shipping forecast](http://www.met-office.gov.uk/datafiles/offshore.html).

No cream teas to [review](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/05/afternoon_tea_and_teashops), but I can say that the Rainbow cafe does good bacon sandwiches.
