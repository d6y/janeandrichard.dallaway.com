We buy quite a lot of stuff online these days. You still have to be careful. Here are two recent experiences&#8230;

One. For some years we&#8217;ve been buying travel insurance on-line from [Worldcover direct](http://worldcoverdirect.com/). It&#8217;s not the cheapest, but it&#8217;s easy enough: fill in a form, get a quote, hand over your credit card details, print out a confirmation that you&#8217;re insured and also a few weeks later stuff arrives in the post. For our trip to [Malta](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/malta/index.html), we renewed our annual insurance as usual. A few months after the trip, Jane noticed that we&#8217;d not received anything through the post. Odd. Our credit card had been charged, so I emailed Worldcover and discovered that they had no record of our policy. Sure they were polite and helpful on the phone, but it did take a fist full of emails, and three or four calls over two or three weeks to get to the bottom of it. In the end I had to send them a photocopy of our credit card statement (they&#8217;d found records of all our previous policies, so they knew we&#8217;re loyal customers, but still wanted proof). It later turned out that &#8220;some files hadn&#8217;t been transferred from their web site&#8221; (or something like that). So&#8230; what would have happened if we needed some help while we were in Malta? Don&#8217;t know, but it probably would have been long and messy. Will I ever use this company again? Maybe if they half their prices.

And in contrast&#8230;

Two. A while ago we ordered a stack of DVDs from [Splash DVD](http://www.splashdvd.com/). One of the items, [Moulin Rouge!](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2001/10/if_the_idea_of), wasn&#8217;t out yet, so they shipped it a couple of months later and only then charged us. Checking the credit card statement, we spotted that they&#8217;d charged us twice. So, oh no, another email battle&#8230; I emailed Splash DVD asking them to sort this out. Less than 24 hours later I got this reply: &#8220;I have checked our records and you are correct. Apologies for the error. I have refunded your card &#163;14.49 today and this should appear back on your statement within 2 working days.&#8221;. Now, that kind of mistake I can accept, and I&#8217;ve got no hesitation in shopping with them again.
