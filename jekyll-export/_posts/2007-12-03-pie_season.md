Mince pie season has kicked off for me, starting with a six pack from [KaiOrganic](http://www.kaiorganic.co.uk) in nearby Hove.

These are billed as &#8220;filled with naturally fruity mincemeat laced with cognac&#8221;. This is incorrect. It should say &#8220;absolutely packed&#8221; not just simply &#8220;filled&#8221;. The filling is not only generous, but very tasty. Quite rich, as you would expect for a mince pie. Working outwards we encounter the pastry, which is sweet and soft, rating around 2 or 3 on the Crumb Drop Scale. A light dusting of icing sugar gives the impression of a home made quality product. 

The packaging is a reassuringly flimsily cardboard box with a large cellophane window, sealed with a silver label along one edge. Inside the pies are further sealed in two rows, each of three pies each. In our tests 2/3rds of the pies suffered significant damaged in transit. So take care.

Our rating: Buy! Plus, being organic, and having a short shelf-life, you have a great excuse to munch your way through the lot.

**The Crumb Drop Scale:**

  * 5 &#8211; Pieces of pastry explode off the pie or pastry at high speed, making &#8220;ping&#8221; noises as they hits crockery. Someone comments: &#8220;you could&#8217;ve had an eye out with that&#8221;. 
  * 4 &#8211; You look down at your shirt, or lap, in horror at the amount of crumbs.
  * 3 &#8211; Light flaking: may be difficult to contain in a strong breeze.
  * 2 &#8211; Very little crumb drop. Slight risk of small flakes adhering to the lip.
  * 1 &#8211; A solid pastry producing no crumbs at all. Consider returning the pie to the store.
