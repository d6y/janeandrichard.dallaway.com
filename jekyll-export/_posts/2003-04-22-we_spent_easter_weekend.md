We spent Easter weekend in Hull visiting my parents, and managed to fit in quite a lot &#8211; a Hull City match (we won!), some touristy stuff as well as setting Dad up with a new PC. As usual I took heaps of photos, so I&#8217;ll get around to processing them sometime soon. 

Update: The photos are now up [here](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/easter2003/).
