Being a non-smoker I&#8217;m really interested in the news that [Ireland stubs out smoking in pubs](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3577001.stm). Listening to the radio last night, someone from a UK pub chain was commenting that similar legislation in the UK was inevitable, probably in the next five years. 

There&#8217;s much noise from pub and restaurant owners that this is going to kill off their business, but apparently there was also similar complaints when drink driving laws were enforced. Anyhow, it seems that almost everyone agrees that there will be some drop in trade, but in Ireland it seems that the your-health-comes-first argument has won out. 

This is brilliant news, it&#8217;s just odd that it happened in [Ireland](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/Ireland2002.html) first: I mean, when I was in Ireland the pubs I visited were probably the smokiest places I&#8217;ve ever been to in my life.
