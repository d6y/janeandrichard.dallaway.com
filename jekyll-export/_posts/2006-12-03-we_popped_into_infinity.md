We popped into [Infinity](http://www.infinityfoods.co.uk/) for some food for the week and decided we were hungry, so figured we&#8217;d try some of [Clive&#8217;s Pies](http://www.clivespies.co.uk/). And I have to say, they were fab. We went for one Arabian chickpea and one Hungarian &#8211; the chickpea one was our favourite, but we&#8217;re going to try some of the others soon.
