A week or so ago, iTunes offered an episode of &#8220;[A Town called Panic](http://www.atowncalledpanic.tv/)&#8221; as a free download. I downloaded, watched, laughed and then bought the series (Note: it can be watched for free [here](http://www.atom.com/channel/channel_aardman/)). It is bizarre, and amusing and I love that horse sounds like Bernard Manning.
