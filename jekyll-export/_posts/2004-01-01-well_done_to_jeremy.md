Well done to Jeremy and Andy for braving the
  
Brighton sea on Christmas morning.
  
We watched the crazy folk going in
  
[last year](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/christmasday2002/), on what was an unusually
  
warm day, and Jeremy said he thought he&#8217;d give it a go in 2003. 

I think Andy was talked or bullied into it
   
the night before, but I may be wrong.
   
I assumed he was joking about going in wearing the Santa costume.

Once fortified with mulled wine, they dived in and
  
did the required full submersion and at least five strokes &#8212; this
   
being Kirsty&#8217;s definition of the minimum needed
   
to qualify as &#8220;going for a swim on Christmas morning&#8221;. This all
  
happened to be before the official Christmas day swimmers
   
got going, thereby inadvertently grabbing the attention
  
of the crowd on the beach, including the press.
