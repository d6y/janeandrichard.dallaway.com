I bought my first ever [open house](http://www.aoh.org.uk/2007/) art purchase during this years Brighton Festival. 

She is called Valentine and was painted by [Sioux Hurman](http://www.robyndillon.co.uk/sioux/).

I spotted this picture the [day I first visited](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2007/05/brighton_festival) the [Shadow Box Open House](http://www.robyndillon.co.uk/) in Tidy Street. She is just so vivid and eye catching. I dragged Richard back with me the following week, just to make sure he didn&#8217;t hate it and that if I bought it, I could have it on display and not tucked away at the back of a cupboard somewhere&#8230; 

He approved, I bought her and on Sunday I collected her, and brought her home. She is now happily hanging on the wall in our hallway.<br clear="all" />
