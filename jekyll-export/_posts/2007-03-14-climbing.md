So, since I last mentioned [climbing](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2007/02/evolution_climbing_wall) I&#8217;ve progressed well. I finished the course, having a futher 2 sessions, both of which were led by the excellent Ross who taught really well. I&#8217;ve continued to attend every week, and so Wednesday evenings will found me in the bouldering area progressing. This evening I had the opportunity to watch a couple of excellent climbers climb elegantly on routes that I&#8217;m troubled with. My upper body strength is improving, as is the strength in my fingers but I still have a long way to go to be able to climb with the grace and precision that I&#8217;ve seen &#8211; still progress is progress and every week I&#8217;m managing to achieve more difficult routes.
