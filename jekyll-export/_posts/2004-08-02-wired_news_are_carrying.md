[Wired News]() are carrying a [story](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64419,00.html/wn_ascii) about [Joshua Kinberg](http://a.parsons.edu/~jk/spectropolis/josh.html), a guy who is leaving [Anti Bush messages around New York using his pushbike, a dot matrix printer and a powerbook](http://www.bikesagainstbush.com/). His previous project was [magicbike](http://www.magicbike.net/), a mobile WiFi hotspot. Sounds like a smart guy with some interesting technology projects on the go.
