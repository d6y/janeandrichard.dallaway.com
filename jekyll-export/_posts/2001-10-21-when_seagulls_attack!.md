We had [friends visiting us](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2001-10-20/) yesterday, and as Simes couldn&#8217;t remember ever being to Brighton before we decided to go for a wander along the sea front and onto the pier. Steff bought us all a doughnut and we were munching away happily as we wandered along. I was wandering in front of the others and suddenly had my doughnut taken out of my hand by a seagull. It just flew in over my head and grabbed the doughnut, all of it &#8211; I&#8217;d only eaten one or two bites of it, and flew away. The others, who were still behind me, were probably as shocked as I was, as were various onlookers who could be heard proclaiming &#8220;That lady just had a doughnut taken out of her hand by a seagull&#8221;. For the rest of the time we were on the pier we kept watching the seagulls eyeing other peoples snacks up, but didn&#8217;t see anymore doughnut theft.
