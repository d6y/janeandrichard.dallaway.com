After catching the second half of last year&#8217;s [The Apprentice](http://www.thisishull.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=197370&command=displayContent&sourceNode=197368& home=yes&more_nodeId1=136245&contentPK=14458909), we started watching this series from the beginning and have enjoyed watching the comings and goings. I&#8217;m pretty impressed that an ex-pupil of the [senior school](http://www.sydneysmith.hull.sch.uk/) I went to, [Michelle](http://www.bbc.co.uk/apprentice/candidates/michelle.shtml), went on to win it and is now [Alan Sugar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sugar)&#8216;s Apprentice. An excellent programme.
