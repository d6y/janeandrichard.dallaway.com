So much for modern technology and government initiatives. The [Inland Revenue](http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk) [still](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2002/06/having_gathered_together_all) haven&#8217;t got their self-assesment service back on line yet. It has to be completed by the end of September and I just want to get on with it, so I&#8217;ve resorted to calling them up and asking them to send me a form through. It \*really\* grates to have to resort to filling in paper based forms, but I want to get it out of the way before the [wedding](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedlog/) build-up really starts. Bah!
