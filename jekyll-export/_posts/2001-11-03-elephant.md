I&#8217;ve known about the [GPS Art](http://www.gpsdrawing.com/info.htm) web site for a while, but I didn&#8217;t realize that there was a [Brighton Elephant](http://www.gpsdrawing.com/gallery/land/belephant.htm) or that it had made it as a [BBC News story](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/in_depth/sci_tech/2000/dot_life/newsid_1595000/1595670.stm). Must have been a slow news day.
