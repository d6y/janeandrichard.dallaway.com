Go to [Google](http://www.google.com/), type &#8220;Weapons of Mass Destruction&#8221; into the search box and press the &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling lucky&#8221; button. It should take you to [this mock error page](http://www.coxar.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/). I particularly like the title of the page &#8220;Cannot find Weapons of Mass Destruction&#8221;.
