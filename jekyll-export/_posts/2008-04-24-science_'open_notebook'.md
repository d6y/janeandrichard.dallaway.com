One to file under &#8220;wish I&#8217;d thought of that&#8221;, from [Slashdot](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/04/22/0041232&from=rss):

Under [the] radically transparent &#8216;open notebook&#8217; approach, everything goes online: experimental protocols, successful outcomes, failed attempts, even discussions of papers being prepared for publication&#8230; The time stamps on every entry not only establish priority but allow anyone to track the contributions of every person, even in a large collaboration.
