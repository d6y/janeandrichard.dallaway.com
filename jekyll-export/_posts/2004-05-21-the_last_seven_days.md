The last seven days have seen: our first beach BBQ of the year (pictured); our first drift-down-to-the-beach-of-an-evening-for-a-beer night of the year; and our one and only [Brighton Festival](http://www.brighton-festival.org.uk/) event of the year, which was to see [Richard Dawkins and Lalla Ward](http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/scienceandnature/story/0,6000,892495,00.html).
