We visited my folks in Hull in September, and as usual took a day trip on Saturday to show Richard more of Yorkshire. This time we visited somewhere that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d been to since a school trip when I was 10 or 11 or so &#8211; [Dalby Forest](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/dalbyforest). It&#8217;s a pretty impressive place, although not as rugged as I remember from my childhood. The most impressive thing was the tea served by Mrs Davison at Jingleby Thorn &#8211; where in the South could you get 4 mugs of tea, 2 slices of fruit loaf, one scone and jam and one scone with cream and jam for &#xA3;6! Bargain!
