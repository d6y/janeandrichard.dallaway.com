I&#8217;ve just been out and bought a new gadget. I&#8217;m replacing my stolen Visor Deluxe with a [Handera 330](http://www.handera.com/products/330.asp). The Handera has a lot of improvements over the Visor Deluxe, in the form of a higher resolution screen, a software grafitti area, a jog dial, a microphone which works (the Visor has one that does nothing). I&#8217;m sure to be spending the next couple of days playing with it, and adding lots of programs to it.
