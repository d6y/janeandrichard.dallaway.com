This is a test movie I put together so I could discover how to use the 16:9 setting on the camera, to see how to edit with 16:9, and how to export it. I also wanted to see how I&#8217;d get on hand-holding the camera on a cycle.

It turned out to be a great lesson, but unfortunately a terrible piece of video. Sorry about that. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned&#8230; 

In the first half of the film I was cycling with the camera resting on the handlebars, using my right hand to press the camera onto the handle bars. This is bad for two reason: first, I couldn&#8217;t signal in traffic to turn right; second, the vibrations from the road through the camera has crippling effects on the recording. 

Later I was cycling essentially one handed, which produced smoother film. It also allowed me to try out changing the filming angle. 

Other stuff: cycling against a strong wind, while filming, resulting in me wheezing. Combined with the occasional loud sniff makes for some horrible sound. Gah. But it was a good exercise for me in blending and offsetting the sound from different clips&#8212;more so later in the sequence than earlier. Oh, and I learned that I need to oil my cycle: some of the squeaks and rattling sounds are embarrassing ðŸ™‚ 

But that aside the 16:9 part kind of works. I had to jump through a few hoops to export the movie into iDVD. Although the 16:9 export from FCE has the right aspect ratio in QuickTime player, it imports to iDVD as 3:4. I don&#8217;t have QuickTime Pro, so I couldn&#8217;t use the [official Apple workaround](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305337) for this, or [Anamorphicizer](http://homepage.mac.com/sith33/FileSharing34.html), so to get round it I had to pull the movie into iMovie08 and then export from that. It works.

Initially I was deeply unhappy with the output, especially when viewed on TV. Then I found the &#8220;Deinterlace Source Video&#8221; checkbox in the size option box from &#8220;File/Export QuickTime Conversion&#8230;&#8221; (which is where I also picked &#8220;PAL 720&#215;576 16:9&#8221; for the dimensions). Lots of jaggies in the original, all gone when deinterlaced. 

The version here is a result of exporting from iMovie08 using the &#8220;Share/Export Movie&#8221; menu, and picking the &#8220;medium&#8221; format.
