Saturday, Ealing, London: a day out in the park on what must be close
  
to the hottest day of the year so far. 

The excuse: a free extreme day organized by the
  
local government, where we could try out various extreme sports. It turned out to be dominated by kids, but hey&#8230; we invited the New Scientist web team over,
  
we had fun and discovered that Cathy rules
  
at shooting because she was taught to shoot at school in France.

The end of the day was spent drinking, chatting, and playing football in
  
another park, followed by great tapas at [La Siesta](http://www.lammas.com/food/LaSiesta.html). Mmmm&#8230; great tapas,
  
and enough veggie options to keep Ash happy.

As you&#8217;d expect, there are [eyemodule photos](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/eyemodule/extremeealing.html).

[oh, BTW, this blog is late because we&#8217;ve come to rely on
  
[JPEG Wizard](http://www.jpegwizard.com/) to trim the fat from our images, and the
  
site was down for a day or two]
