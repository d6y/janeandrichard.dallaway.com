As we were watching the [Portugal v Holland](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991538.stm) game we realised that the referee [Valentin Ivanov](http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/ref/37294_IVANOV_Valentin.html) reminded us of [Whose line is it anyway?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whose_Line_is_it_Anyway%3F) contestant [Ryan Stiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Stiles). With 16 yellow cards and 4 sendings off it might as well have been a comedian doing the refereeing.
