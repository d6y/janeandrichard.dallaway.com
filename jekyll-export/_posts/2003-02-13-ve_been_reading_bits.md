I&#8217;ve been reading bits of the [The Sydney Morning Herald](http://www.smh.com.au/) ([Jono](http://www.jonoabroad.com/)&#8216;s fault), and it made for interesting reading: [Eriksson upbeat despite loss](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/england/2755301.stm) (BBC) vs.
  
[Savour the perfect 10](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/13/1044927744243.html) (SMH). More interesting, though, is the SMH&#8217;s take on the UK press ([&#8216;Load of roo-bish&#8217; causes a stink on Fleet Street](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/13/1044927744538.html)) and the BBC&#8217;s take on the Australian press ([Pom-bashing gathers pace](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/england/2756777.stm)).

It&#8217;s quite odd getting different perspectives from &#8220;local&#8221; sources. I might add the [San Francisco Chronicle](http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/) to my reading too.
