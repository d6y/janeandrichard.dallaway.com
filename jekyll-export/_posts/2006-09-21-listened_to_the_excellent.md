I listened to the excellent [IT Conversations: Steve Coast](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1152.html) podcast on my way in to work this morning, which was all about [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/). This is a project I already knew of from the [dConstruct podcasts](http://2006.dconstruct.org/podcast/) as there was a [Brighton mapping workshop](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Brighton#Brighton_Mapping_Workshop) the day after dConstruct.

I don&#8217;t have a GPS unit, but my only exposure to one was excellent. Whilst in [Colorado](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/colorado2006/) snowboarding in March we found out about the [SlopeTracker](http://www.slopetracker.com/) service, and rented a unit at Copper Mountain. The end result of this was a piste map with our routes marked on it, along with statistics such as maximum speed, miles travelled, time spent boarding etc ([sample map](http://www.slopetracker.com/images/copper_sample(big-web).jpg)). A great service. So today I started investigating what other ski resorts you could get GPS based maps for, and I stumbled across [Mountain Dynamics](http://www.mountaindynamics.com/en/index.php) and the [SnowRanger](http://www.mountaindynamics.com/en/snowranger.php) set of resort maps. There&#8217;s an [Uplink](http://www.mountaindynamics.com/en/uplinkinfo.php) tool as well so that you can share your [routes and statistics online](http://www.mountaindynamics.com/en/tracks.php?shared=1).

If we can find a similar service that supports the Mac, then my justification for buying a GPS unit will be in place, and then maybe I can start to contribute to OpenStreetMap as it sounds like a great project. I especially like the fact that they&#8217;ve proved the existence of [errors](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Catalog_of_Errors) and [easter eggs in the traditional maps](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Copyright_Easter_Eggs). I&#8217;m not sure why, but I&#8217;ve always found the use of fictional roads and landmarks as a way of protecting your copyright to be a bit wrong when your reputation relies on the, otherwise, amazing quality of your data.
