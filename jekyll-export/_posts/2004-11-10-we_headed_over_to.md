We headed over to [Lewes](http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/) for the [Bonfire celebrations](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3988037.stm) on Friday &#8211; it was a pretty chilly night but we stuck around long enough to watch the processions before heading home to warm up with a lovely pecan pie treat. I took some photos, but at the moment they&#8217;re still in a processing queue &#8211; so, if you want to see what its all about there are photos for [2003](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/2003_11_05/), [2002](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/bonfire_2002/) and [2001](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/bonfire_2001/).
