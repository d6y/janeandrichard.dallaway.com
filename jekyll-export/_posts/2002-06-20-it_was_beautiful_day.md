It was a beautiful day here in Brighton yesterday and so we went for a walk along the beach and decided to stop for a pint. This was a really splendid way of spending time, drinking beer watching the wakeboarders fall in the sea. We then headed off to the [BNM](http://www.brightonnewmedia.org) social at the [Sussex Arts Club](http://www.sussexarts.com/) (quite an interesting place) and met some new people, and met up with some we&#8217;d met before. As we were heading home, we discovered that one of the restaurants in Boyce&#8217;s Street is being refitted to become a [Nando&#8217;s](http://www.nandos.co.uk/) and is due to open in August. This is great news for us as Nando&#8217;s is one of the only things we&#8217;ve missed about not being in Ealing. Nando&#8217;s is great takeaway food, tasty chicken with a peri peri sauce. Yummmm! Roll on August.
