I&#8217;ve mentioned I&#8217;ve been [working out of the Werks](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2008/01/the_werks). Well&#8230; it&#8217;s been a month now [over a month, but this blog post has been sitting around whilst I was away] and in that time I&#8217;ve visited the Werks ten times or so. I&#8217;m not sure exactly how often, but long enough and frequently enough for the [coffee shop](http://www.real-eating.co.uk/hove.htm) to know what my order is.

Unexpectedly I&#8217;ve ended up having about three times the number of meetings I&#8217;d normally have&#8212;the good kind of meeting, mind you. That&#8217;s down to being able to say &#8220;just drop by&#8221; rather than having to actually arrange anything. An example: Danny popping round the other day and we had the space to spread out his Post-Its&#174; and discuss a bunch of ideas.

I get the sense that there&#8217;s a good chance of chance happenings happening&#8212;especially once more of the space is used. I&#8217;d expect more people to be showing up once we&#8217;re out of the dismal months.

A few times I find it better to work from the home office, for instance if I need the printer, make tricky phone calls, or just absolutely need guaranteed quiet. But mostly I&#8217;ve noticed that I may be getting more done when I do go to the Werks. As odd as it might seem, having to plan the day around what you need (that file? that external drive?) and then _having_ to head out, seems to set the tone for the day. Prevents thrashing. Create focus. Something like that.
