I bought Richard a [snowboard controller](http://www.gameseek.co.uk/productdetail/PS2qtrmqt1rg077keax/) for the PS2 for Christmas. Last night I used it to play [SSX3](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009LW7Q/richarddallaway) (rather than just use [SSX](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068CHU/richarddallaway) in training mode and try and achieve a straight line which had been all I managed to date). I&#8217;m not sure how much, if any, it&#8217;ll help me when we go snowboarding later in the season, but my calf muscles ache so I guess it&#8217;ll strengthen them if nothing else.
