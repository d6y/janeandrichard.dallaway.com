My hatred of spammers increases by the day. The latest trick I&#8217;ve seen hitting my mailbox is spam that looks just like message failure reports. Messages from &#8220;Mail delivery subsystem&#8221; with a subject of &#8220;Returned mail: see transcript for details&#8221;. This is so annoying. Or would be, but luckily I use [SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.org/) to clean my mailbox for me. Every so often I check the &#8220;spam&#8221; folder to see what it&#8217;s caught, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve seen all these &#8220;Returned mail:&#8221; spam. SpamAssassin works; but how long before the spammers get the upper hand&#8230;?
