I&#8217;ve been looking after the [Brighton Bloggers](http://www.brightonbloggers.com/) site, and consequently this morning got an email from someone wanting a blog added to the list of [Brighton Blogs](http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blogs/). The email said &#8220;[BEACHED](http://www.plot9.com/beached/today.htm) is a photographic Blog chronicling life on
  
Brighton Beach, England during British Summertime 2004.&#8221; Great concept, and so far it&#8217;s quite lovely.
