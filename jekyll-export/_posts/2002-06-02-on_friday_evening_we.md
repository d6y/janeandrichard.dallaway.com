On Friday evening we went on a bit of a pub crawl as Susie&#8217;s leaving do. But this was no ordinary pub crawl &#8211; we played pub golf. We had a 9 pub golf course and we had a set drink and amount to do in every pub. To make par we had to drink what was on the card. To get a birdie we had to drink double the quantity, an eagle was double the quantity and a single spirit, an albatross was double the quantity and a double spirit and a hole in one was an albatross downed in one!

Our course and drinks were:

  * The [Grand Hotel](http://www.grandbrighton.co.uk/) &#8211; Long Island Ice Tea or other cocktail &#8211; Par 3
  * The Walkabout Lodge &#8211; Pint &#8211; Par 5
  * The Fiddlers Elbow &#8211; Half &#8211; Par 4
  * The Cricketers &#8211; Half &#8211; Par 4
  * The Bath Arms &#8211; Pint &#8211; Par 5
  * The Font and Firkin &#8211; Half &#8211; Par 3
  * The Victory &#8211; Half &#8211; Par 4
  * The Western Front &#8211; Half &#8211; Par 3
  * Weatherspoons &#8211; Pint &#8211; Par 5

We only got as far as the Western Front by closing time, so both Weatherspoons and the club House (The Grand Hotel again) were missed out on. Not a great shame really as we&#8217;d all had quite enough to drink by then. Don&#8217;t forget to take a look at [the photos](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/Susieleaving2/).
