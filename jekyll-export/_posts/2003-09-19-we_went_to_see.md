We went to see [The Treason Show](http://freespace.virgin.net/treason.show/tshow/) at [Komedia](http://www.komedia.co.uk/) last night. Its a satirical, topical sketch based show and was pretty funny. It was good to go and see some live comedy again, especially in the lead up to the [Brighton Comedy Festival](http://www.brightoncomedyfestival.com) next month.
