The BBC are doing a special holiday programme on [50 things to do before you die](http://www.bbc.co.uk/50/). Currently they&#8217;re accepting submissions from people suggesting ideas of what they&#8217;ve done or what they&#8217;d like to do &#8211; I&#8217;ve submitted two, one I&#8217;ve done and one I&#8217;d love to do.

So, the one I&#8217;ve done is see an eclipse [[Hungary 1999](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/1999/08/hungary/)] and the one I&#8217;d love to do is see the northern lights. I&#8217;m sure I can think of many more, but I thought two was a good start ðŸ™‚
