Pah! Last night, after much debate, we attempted to book a trip to Lisbon through [LastMinute](http://www.lastminute.com/lmn/pso/catalog/Category.jhtml?CATID=3) for 3 days in January. This afternoon at around 5pm we get a call to tell us that the flights are booked up and we can&#8217;t go. Can&#8217;t be helped I suppose, but what is really annoying is that LastMinute is still showing these dates as available. They offered us a trip to Rome instead, but we really wanted somewhere a bit warmer than that. So, we called up [Crystal](http://www.crystalcities.co.uk) instead and they&#8217;ve found us a trip to Malta. We know very little about the place, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be a nice break before I start my new job on the 7th January.
