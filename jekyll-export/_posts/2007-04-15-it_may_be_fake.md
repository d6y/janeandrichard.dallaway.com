It may be fake, but this weekend The Guardian printed
  
[an article on global warming](http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2057059,00.html) (Sat 4 April, p. 26) which I like very much. Of course, liking it doesn&#8217;t make it right&#8230;. 

The gist of the article is this: there&#8217;s a lot of worry about global warming, and the cause, but &#8220;Earth&#8217;s resources are finite; the planet is doomed to die [&#8230;] and the solution is clear: we must seek other planets to colonise. Earth may be good for 10,000 years or so; then it will be time to find a new home, or homes&#8212;a literal New World.&#8221;

Original? No. I first heard this from the mouth of [Bart Simpson](http://www.rob-clarkson.com/duff-brewery/bart-quotes.php): &#8221; Aw, recycling&#8217;s useless Lis. Once the Sun burns out, this planet is doomed. You&#8217;re just making sure we spend our last days using inferior products.&#8221;

Anyway, the thing about new worlds that troubles me is this: pretty much any planet that&#8217;s habitable is going to be inhabited, because life&#8217;s like that. So any new world we colonize is going to be one of those SF moves here the aliens come to take over the Earth, except, we&#8217;re the bad aliens. More funding for [terraforming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming), I say.
