We managed another couple of comedy events as part of the [Brighton Comedy Festival](http://www.brightoncomedyfestival.com/). Last Sunday we saw the excellent [Ross Noble](http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/) at the [Dome](http://brightondome.org/). Very funny, and judging from some of the [reviews](http://www.theargus.co.uk/display.var.950128.0.ross_noble_fizzy_logic_brighton_dome_concert_hall_oct_14_and_15.php), he improvises a lot, changing a lot of his material from show to show. 

Last night we saw [Jo Caulfield](http://www.jocaulfield.com/) at the Pavillion Theatre. Her show is all about [things that make you angry and annoyed](http://www.jocaulfield.com/angryandannoyed.php), allowing for amusing rants about argos, familes and leaving time to take audience suggestions &#8211; a lot of people in Brighton seem to be annoyed by cyclists!! She&#8217;d done her research about Brighton, being able to name various landmarks and appreciate the difference between Brighton and Hove (actually!) which is always a good sign. I thought her idea for a range of greetings cards were great &#8211; &#8220;Congratulations on your marriage, remember the gift I bought you for your first wedding? Good&#8221; :-).

Both of these have been &#8220;laugh out loud funny&#8221; for me. This afternoon we&#8217;re off to see [Paul Merton&#8217;s Silent Clowns](http://brightondome.org/events/eventdetails.asp?id=2098) which includes a full showing of Laurel and Hardy&#8217;s [Big Business](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019688/).
