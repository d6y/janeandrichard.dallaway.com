I made it along to the [Camera Club](http://www.bhcc-online.co.uk/) tonight and am very glad I did. Tonights guest speaker was [Greg Whitmore](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/contacts/page/0,7646,329662,00.html), the picture editor for [The Observer](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/). He showed us some of the recent photographs that he&#8217;s commissioned for the [Food Monthly](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/foodmonthly/) magazine, and then some of the more recent news pictures. This sparked off a long and very interesting debate about all manner of news photography subjects, a lot of which related to the shock tactics used by some papers/photographers, and which turned the evening into the liveliest meeting I&#8217;ve been to so far.
