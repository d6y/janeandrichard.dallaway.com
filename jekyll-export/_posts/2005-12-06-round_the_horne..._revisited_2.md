Last Christmas [Rachel](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/jpdchristening/img_0607_640/), [Steve](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/danielsdecember2001/img_1163_640/) and [the](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/danielsdecember2001/img_1171_640/) [kids](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/danielsdecember2001/img_1153_640/) gave us a set of Ticketmaster vouchers, and we decided we&#8217;d cash them in on something we wouldn&#8217;t normally go to see. We picked [Round the Horne&#8230;Revisited 2](http://www.theambassadors.com/theatreroyal/sp_p1330.html), based on the following &#8220;[logic](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/)&#8220;: (i) we knew it was a [famous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_the_Horne) &#8217;60s radio comedy series; (ii) we love lots of other [radio comedy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/); ergo, we would like this. 

And we did. The show was two episodes of the radio show on stage, with some new work thrown in. The audience were clearly tuned in to certain characters which were over our heads, but we soon got the hang of looking forward Fiona & Charles or [Julian & Sandy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_and_Sandy) (surely the roots of [Ken & Kenneth](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/fastshow/characters/suit_you.shtml)). Time to go away and listen to some of the
  
[original radio series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbc7/comedy/progpages/horne.shtml).
