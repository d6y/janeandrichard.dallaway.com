So, we&#8217;ve seen our last real snow (I think) for the season, and finished with a great long
  
weekend in [Chatel](http://www.chatel.com/www-bienvenueuk-616-HIVER-UK.html) one of the resorts in the [Portes Du Soleil](http://www.portesdusoleil.com/hiver/index.php?lang=en) area. We were really lucky and snow fell the day we
  
travelled and on our first day on the slopes and refreshed some otherwise struggling pistes. We spent one day in the Linga and Pr&#xE9;-la-Joux areas (a great, if low-visibility day), another day in the Lindaret area of [Avoriaz](http://www.avoriaz.com/index.jsp?sdp_season=winter) (our favourite area when we were there [at New Year](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/newyear2005/index.html)) and our final half day in Super Chatel (limited terrain but great for practicing riding switch). Perversely enough, this was amongst the best snow we&#8217;ve had in any of our three trips this season despite it being almost the end of season.
