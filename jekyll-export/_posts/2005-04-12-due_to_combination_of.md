Due to a combination of a small hardware failure and a large amount of user error, I ended up in a situation where our home server [RAID5 disk array](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_array_of_independent_disks) was hosed and our backup disk was failing to respond. It was looking like we&#8217;d have to go back to month old CD backups&#8230; but it didn&#8217;t turn out that way. So thanks to:

  * [GND](http://www.gnd.com/) &#8211; I bought the server from these people over three years ago at [Dave](http://www.hodgkinson.org/)&#8216;s suggestion. Turned out to be good advice. There was something about the Linux set up I didn&#8217;t understand. I dropped them an email, and a few days later I received a phone call from a technical guy, full of knowledge of how my machine was set up, and that helped me work out how to get the machine back. Great customer service. 
  * [TestDisk](http://www.cgsecurity.org/index.html?testdisk.html) &#8211; let&#8217;s say, hypothetically, while installing an operating system on one set of disks, you&#8217;d managed to corrupt the partition table of a different, and perfectly good, set of disk. Once you get past the &#8220;where did my data go?&#8221; shock, what do you do? Use TestDisk to fix the problem. 

BTW, if you decide to have an off-site back up disk in your car, check the disk tolerance before you leave the disk in a car park in Heathrow during double-digit negative temperatures. At one point I looked into professional data recovery services to get the data off this disk. We didn&#8217;t need the service in the end, but [Data Recovery UK](http://www.dataemergency.co.uk/) were fast and friendly and quoted me &#163;85 to perform an initial investigation on this 120G IDE backup drive. It&#8217;d then cost &#163;350 &#8211; &#163;900 to recover the data. Which I thought was fair enough, assuming you value the data.
