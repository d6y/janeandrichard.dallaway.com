Last November I [blogged](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2009/11/dog-friendly-rest-stops-between-hull-and-brighton/) about the dog friendliness of a couple of places we stopped on our drive from Brighton to Hull, and back again.

We did the same trip again this Easter, and stopped at 2 completely different places but using a similar strategy to last time &#8211; avoiding motorway services.

**Elton**

On Good Friday we stopped north of Peterborough in the village of Elton and did a [7.5km circular walk from Elton to Nassington and back](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/02-Apr-10-15_24-EltonNassingtonLoop.kml). It was inspired by a walk named [Elton to Yarwell and Nassington](http://www.nenegallery.co.uk/blog/?p=80) which I found when looking for [walks around Peterborough](http://www.nenegallery.co.uk/blog/?page_id=114).

It was a very pleasant walk, following along the [Nene way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nene_Way) for some of the walk. There were no amenities where we parked, but we drove past a pub on entry to the village though I don&#8217;t know if it was dog-friendly or not.

**Saffron Walden**

On Easter Monday we headed down around Cambridgeshire and stopped at the pretty market town of Saffron Walden. We parked at the free long-stay car park near the football ground, and managed a [5km circular walk](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://static.janeandrichard.co.uk/maps/2010/05-Apr-10-16_32-SaffronWalden.kml) following the walk entitled [Park and Gardens Walk](http://www.chesterford.org.uk/walks_from_saffron_walden/walk4.html), again found on the internet.

Another pleasant stroll, combining parkland and town streets. The [Bridge End Gardens](http://dms.visitsaffronwalden.gov.uk/thedms.aspx?dms=13&venue=0230384) looked very nice but weren&#8217;t dog friendly so we didn&#8217;t investigate. The [Audley End](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/audley-end-house-and-gardens/) Park area was very pleasant and worth a stroll. We spotted a few pubs, cafes, tea rooms etc during our walk and would hope that at least one of them would be dog friendly, but we didn&#8217;t stop and find out.

So, as with last time, 2 very different places and 2 very different walks. The Elton walk was more like our normal hikes around fields and countryside, whilst the Saffron Walden walk was much more town and street based.
