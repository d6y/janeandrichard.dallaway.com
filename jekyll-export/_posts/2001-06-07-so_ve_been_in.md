So I&#8217;ve been in San Francisco for JavaOne for three or four days now. Lots of fun stuff, techy stuff&#8230; but I do like the circus elements:
  
a bunch of 20 or 30 bikers on Harleys circling the conference centre on the first day; the guy on a unicycle teaching the crowd how to juggle; the biplanes flying over with vendor messages; having t-shirts shot at us; watching my first ice hokey game (didn&#8217;t understand a thing); keynote talks that start with comedy sketches based on Survivor; song and some dance; keynote speaches that start with half an hour of Taiko drumming (Taiko drumming twice in five days.. pretty good, eh?); the opportunity to tell vendors that you hate their product&#8230; you get the idea.

The free beer is good, too
