Wycombe beat Leicester to get into the FA Cup semi-final (they&#8217;re going to play Liverpool). Not a bad achievement for a 2nd division team, especially one who had to advertise to find a striker, and who signed an unknown player from Belfast, Roy Essandoh, less than a week before the game on a 2 week contract. Quote from the [Wycombe page on the Nationwide website](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/football/NationwideLeague/Division2/TeamNews.asp?TeamID=136&ID=12670) &#8211; &#8220;Ten days ago the Wanderers striker was out of work but he responded to an Internet plea from the Adams Park outfit for a new goalscorer that duly led to the second half substitute notching the dramatic winner.&#8221;

Hull City lost to Brighton at the Withdean stadium by 3 goals to nothing. That result leaves Brighton 2nd in the league, and pushes Hull down to 10th. If we&#8217;d even got one point we&#8217;d have been in the play-off spot. There are rumours starting to circulate about who our new owners are, and apparently a press conference is expected at 5pm today&#8230; watch this space
