To celebrate [English Wine Week](http://www.english-wine-week.com) we decided to take a trip to [Nyetimber Vineyard](http://www.nyetimber-vineyard.com/), a vineyard under [an hour away](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=rh20+2hh& spn=0.031189,0.041765& hl=en) that produces sparkling wines that we&#8217;d heard good things about and which isn&#8217;t usually open to the public. We tasted three of their wines before joining a tour to learn more about how they put the fizz in. On the way to Nyetimber we&#8217;d spotted another vineyard close by, also open for tastings and so popped into the more tourist focussed [Nutbourne Vineyards](http://www.nutbournevineyards.com/) for more tasting. A great way to spend a bank holiday afternoon.
