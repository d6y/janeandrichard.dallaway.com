I had an interview on Friday, and among other bizarre questions I was asked if I planned to have children, and if so what was the timescale. Now I appreciate that I&#8217;m now 31 and that companies would have a concern about the children thing, but I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s an appropriate interview question.

Update: I&#8217;ve since discovered that it is legal to ask that as long as they ask the same questions of all other candidates. They&#8217;re not allowed to make a decision based on the answer though.
