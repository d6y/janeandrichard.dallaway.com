We&#8217;ve had a cracking weekend. A bit of light shopping yesterday afternoon and then off into London (well, Elephant and Castle to be exact) for a birthday/house warming party for Heather. The theme was a children&#8217;s party so there were sandwiches, sausage rolls, fairy cakes as well as party games &#8211; like pin the tail on the [(very depressed looking) donkey](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2528/3980750962_6b1519de9a_o.jpg), and pass the parcel. Excellent idea!

Today we headed off on our first bike ride of the New Year, and it was hard work. The track we often cycle along was frozen so it was a bit like riding a boneshaker at times. Still, it was nice to be out in the fresh air, and it was a beautiful sunny day down here. Shame me and my bike parted company on a particularly muddy bit&#8230; Then we met up with one of our friends for Sunday lunch at [The Regency Restaurant](http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/seafood/regency.html) before stopping to take some photos of the sky at sunset. Then finally, on to see some other friends for tea. An unexpectedly lovely weekend.
