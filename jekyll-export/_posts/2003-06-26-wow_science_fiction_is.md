Wow, science fiction is close to becoming to science reality according to [this article in computing](http://www.computing.co.uk/News/1141834). By the middle of next year the Home Office Immigration and Nationality Directorate hope to have an Iris Recognition System installed at 10 UK sites which will be used by regular Non-UK passengers.
