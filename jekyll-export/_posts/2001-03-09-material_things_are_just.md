Material things are just things and don&#8217;t matter, or something. But still it&#8217;s so good to get our car back again, restored to it&#8217;s former glory after a, er, slight miscalculation caused the car to come into contact with a large concrete block when someone, possibly me, was trying to park it. Could have happened to anyone. Anyway&#8230;It&#8217;s also an excuse to see how images work in blogs.

So this is it, the picture of the back end of our car, all shiny and unscratched. You&#8217;ll have to imagine the &#8220;before shot&#8221;, when this area was dented and mangled.
