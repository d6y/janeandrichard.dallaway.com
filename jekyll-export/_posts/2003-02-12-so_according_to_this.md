So, according to [this article](http://www.brandchannel.com/start1.asp?id=143), [Google](http://www.google.com) was the number one global brand for 2002. Okay, admittedly, it was an on-line poll :-)! However, in [Europe and Africa](http://www.brandchannel.com/2002_BOTY/europe_2002.html), [Nokia](http://www.nokia.com/) was top, with Google not even making the top 10.
