We went to meet [Paul and Tess](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/ealing2brighton/img_0428/)&#8216;s new baby last night in the hospital. I think that Max is the youngest baby I&#8217;ve ever met (he was just over a day old) and it made a nice change to be going to a hospital for a nice reason, and in fact I think it&#8217;s the only time I&#8217;ve ever been visiting to a hospital for a birth rather than some illness or ailment or other.

Afterwards, we headed off to the Earth, Moon and Stars pub for a [Virtual Festival](http://www.virtualfestival.org.uk) meeting. The Virtual Festival is run during May (same time as the Brighton Festival) and tries to introduce new technologies to the community, via multimedia days, and the like. We thought we&#8217;d offer our services and see how we could help.
