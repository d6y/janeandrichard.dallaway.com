I&#8217;m back in San Francisco for the JavaOne conference. I think it&#8217;s either the 4th or 5th visit to the city. The trip over is something like 10 or 11 hours, and I don&#8217;t have a great time on such long flights. Towards the end I was wondering why I put myself through this, but then I snapped out of it and realized what a very lucky boy am I to have the opportunity to go fun places. It&#8217;s just a pisser being away from Jane for a week. 

Ever since I left the house I&#8217;ve had a nagging &#8220;I&#8217;ve forgotten something&#8221; feeling. Somewhere above Canada I realized that it was the snowboards. All the other flights I&#8217;ve been on recently have been to snowy places, lugging lots of kit around and it just seems weird to land in a city and not immediately head towards a mountain. 

The conference starts tomorrow, so today covered all the usual things such as saying &#8220;my body doesn&#8217;t work&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember San Fran being this warm&#8221; and trying to figure out when to eat and drink to try to flip into the time zone as fast as possible. We&#8217;ll be just about right by the time we fly back out.

We&#8217;ve picked up all the registration stuff, and had a bit of time shopping. Looking at lobsters (fun), checking out the [Sony Reader](http://www.flickr.com/photos/d6y/487709212/) (impressive screen, but unusable device), wondering who, exactly, needed shark cartilage as a dietary supplement (answer: [nobody](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_cartilage)), and being overly happy about ordering noodles and being given [42](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything) as our order number.
