[Kevan](http://del.icio.us/kevan) posted a link to an interesting [MSG](http://www.google.com/search?&q=define%3AMSG) article from the Observer [If MSG is so bad for you, why doesn&#8217;t everyone in Asia have a headache?](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/foodmonthly/story/0,9950,1522368,00.html). This is interesting, because I didn&#8217;t know that headaches are claimed to be a common symptom of eating MSG. I do get headaches when I&#8217;ve eaten too much (whatever, too much is) but a recent work meal at [Cosmos, Tunbridge Wells](http://www.cosmo-restaurants.co.uk/tunbridge/index.html) left me with a headache and a slightly drunk feeling &#8211; and I hadn&#8217;t drank anything other than lemonade and water.

From the article: &#8220;Some of the names MSG goes under are:
  
monopotassium glutamate, glutavene, glutacyl, glutamic acid, autolyzed yeast extract, calcium caseinate, sodium caseinate, E621 (E620-625 are all glutamates), Ajinomoto, Ac&#8217;cent, Gourmet Powder.&#8221;

I&#8217;ve spotted E621 on a few things recently, and wondered if that was MSG as well&#8230;
