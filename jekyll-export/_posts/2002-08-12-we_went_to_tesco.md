We went to [Tesco](http://www.tesco.com/)&#8216;s this evening to do some grocery shopping, and whilst we were picking up some fruit juice I noticed some Disney fruit drink labelled &#8220;[Roo Juice](http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/story.jsp?story=307981)&#8221; with a picture of [Kanga and Roo](http://members.aol.com/purrfctkty/kangaandroo.html) on the front. Poor little roo&#8230; Good job they didn&#8217;t name it after Winnie the Pooh though isn&#8217;t it ðŸ™‚
