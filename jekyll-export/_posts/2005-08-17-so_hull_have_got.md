So, Hull have got off to an okay start in the [Championship](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/default.stm), shame about [losing to Wolves](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4127136.stm) on Saturday though &#8211; and of course it had to be Wolves, Richard&#8217;s Dad&#8217;s team :-(. I&#8217;m glad I only had a couple of quid riding on it!
