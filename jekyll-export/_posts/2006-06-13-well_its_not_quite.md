Well its not quite a month since I blogged with relief that [Peter Taylor wasn&#8217;t joining Charlton](http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2006/05/glad_to_read_on), unfortunately he isn&#8217;t going to stay at Hull either and is joining [Cystal Palace instead](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/5067262.stm) :-(. The only positive is that Hull gets compensation for him going. [Mick McCarthy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_McCarthy), [Joe Royle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Royle), [Dave Penney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Penney), [Martin Allen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Allen), [Steve Tilson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Tilson) and [Phil Parkinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Parkinson) are the names currently being lined up with the job.
