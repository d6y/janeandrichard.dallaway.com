The web logs for this site tell us that people have been asking search engines questions like &#8220;when is pancake day&#8221; or &#8220;pancake day 2003 UK&#8221; and ending up [on a page of pancake pictures from last year](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/pancakes2002/). Not very helpful. So, for those of your searching for this information&#8230;.This year, pancake day is Tuesday 4th March (2003).

&#8221;

Pancake day is always the day before Ash Wednesday. Ash Wednesday is 40 days before Easter. And you can work out the date for Easter with [some maths](http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/etc/ktf/app/easter.html) (including C source code. Woohoo).
