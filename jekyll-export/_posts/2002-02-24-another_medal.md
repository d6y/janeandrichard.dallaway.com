I didn&#8217;t get to see much of the Olympics over the weekend as we were in Hull (see the [wedlog](http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedlog/archive/2002_02_01_index.xml#10076168)). But, I was really pleased when Dad told me that Britain (okay, Scotland again) had won another medal &#8211; this time a bronze for ski-ing. Apparently this is the [first British medal on snow](http://news.bbc.co.uk/winterolympics2002/hi/english/alpine_skiing/newsid_1838000/1838032.stm). Fantastic stuff. This must make these the most successful Olympics for Britain ever!!!
