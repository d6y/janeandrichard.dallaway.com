We went out on the bikes again on Saturday, and this time took the camera with us. It was pretty windy at the top of Fulking Hill, and we had a change of route when we decided that if we went along the real route (from the trails leaflet) we&#8217;d be blown down into the valley &#8211; not so tempting really!
