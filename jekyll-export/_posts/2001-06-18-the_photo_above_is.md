<img src="http://v1.janeandrichard.co.uk/blog/img/flightinfo.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="In-flight information screen gone wrong" />&#8221;

The photo above is of an in-flight information screen on a flight _from_ the UK. Notice anything wrong
  
with that picture? It&#8217;s difficult to make out but the aircraft in the middle of the screen is stuck on
  
route _into_ the UK. Notice also the system crash log text at the top of the image. Not very reassuring, but
  
as we were already at 30,000ft or something, there wasn&#8217;t much point worrying about it.
