Maybe old news, but I&#8217;ve only just spotted that The Economist is offering [audio interviews online](http://www.economist.com/audio/). They don&#8217;t quite get it, in that they are in streaming format, which just means I have to [jump through hoops](http://www.goulbourn.com/2004/09/converting-stream-to-local-mp3.html) to get the content onto the iPod.
