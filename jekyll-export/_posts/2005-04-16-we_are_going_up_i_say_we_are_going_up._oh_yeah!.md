We looked at the league tables on Vodafone Live at 5pm, and the tables hadn&#8217;t been updated. So we didn&#8217;t know until the BBC told us that Hull have been [promoted into the Championship](http://www.hullcityafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10338~653917,00.html?ptvParm=). I had to pause TiVo and rewind to make sure I&#8217;d heard right! 

Using the tried and trusted maths of &#8220;messing with the equations until it looks right&#8221; we predict Hull to be top of the Prem by 2017. But more pressingly, we need Brighton to stay up so we can go watch Hull play them next year.

Two promotions in two years. All together now: &#8220;One more! We only want one more&#8230;.&#8221;
