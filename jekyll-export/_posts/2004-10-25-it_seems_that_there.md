It seems that there won&#8217;t be any [European Brighton Bears games this season after a sponsor pulled out](http://www.brightonbears.com/news/news_detail.asp?news_id=763). Shame, I was looking forward to the odd Tuesday evening euro league match.

We went to see the [Bears v Sharks](http://www.brightonbears.com/news/news_detail.asp?news_id=746) match the other weekend at the Triangle, taking our 8 year old nephew with us &#8211; he seemed to really enjoy the whole occasion, so I suspect we&#8217;ll end up taking him to another game this [season](http://www.brightonbears.com/fixtures/fixtures.asp).
